life doesnt get better unless you take actions to make it better but depression itself can make it impossible to act exercisephysical activity eating healthy spending time in nature finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to be good for your mental health but by definition depression is a problem precisely because it inhibits your inability to function much less do things that are good for you finding a therapist trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctorpsychiatrist every few weeks or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more or not even work all takes so much fucking effort that i cant bother to do any of it i went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life and i just didnt know how to tell them that is exactly the problem i have utterly no will to do any of that and thats why im sitting in your office right now and i dont know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way if people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves we wouldnt need to classify it as an illness or disorder thats why its so infuriating when we see how even professional mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which i cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation its so irrational and frustrating that im physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk but i have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever but then i just get sad and start spiralling from guilt and i cant stop thinking about how irrational it is even though ive experienced it for so many years im constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence as if i ever expected anything different more than hopelessness i just feel confused as to what im supposed to do when i cant will myself to do anything what even is this anymore edit thank you for all the comments i didnt expect to get any response its hard to describe but i feel very moved that there are people out there that i reached in a small way for a short moment of time,reddit,Unlabeled,0,2020-08-02T18:40:00,en,8248596055421102617

anxiety pro tip anxiety thrives on your avoidance if you have an anxietyprovoking task to do make it your first task of the day otherwise itll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind avoiding the anxietyprovoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat this is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good however avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task is a threatening one so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether youll likely feel better as youll get a sense of achievement from beating the anxietyprovoking thing there is also the added bonus that it wont be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day all credit for this tip goes to utomclinpsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason luckily i had screenshot it because it felt so profound to me,reddit,Unlabeled,0,2020-05-20T17:17:45,en,-5892349891041843545

a letter to those who dont have fomo dear friend who doesnt suffer from fomo your mental attitude surprises me you are unaffected when you go on snapchat and see the stories that your friends post when they are at a party without you the same is true when you go on find my friends and you see two of your best friends together while you are at home alone you dont feel like you are missing out on anything special and instead just passively watch not letting anything get to your head maybe you are an introvert and being at large gatherings makes you uncomfortable i understand how you can find happiness being alone binging your favorite show fomo also known as fear of missing out is a word that eats at my mental health but not yours fomo is defined as the anxiety brought about when you feel like you are missing out on experiences or knowledge i am someone who always wants to be in the know and wants to be included even if i am unable to go somewhere because i have a conflict i still want the invite its important to me to feel like i am wanted somewhere while you can simply appreciate the fact that your friends are having fun given todays culture i am genuinely surprised that you dont suffer from crippling fomo social media has perpetuated fomo when people go out they attempt to produce fomo in others by posting on social media maybe you understand better than i do that social media can be deceiving when i am out and someone i am with posts a video it can seem like the most fun thing ever when it often really isnt plenty of research has shown the negative effects of social media on mental health you see other people looking like they are having the time of their lives and you arent i really wish that i could just look at something i am left out of and not care i wish that not being included in something didnt leave me with terrible anxiety and feeling somewhat depressed this feeling is consistent with my tendency to overthink things something small often becomes an ordeal in my mind as i construct reasons as to why i am alone or not invited such as no one wants to hang out with me this mindset becomes frustrating when someone i always hang out with or used to has moved to only hanging out with one of my other best friends i recognize that we all struggle with problems and hardships in our lives im not saying that just because you dont have severe fomo your life is perfect instead its just easy for me to imagine that your life is a little better than mine i am sure that overcoming an obstacle or struggling with being an introvert is difficult to go through as well with everything going on in our lives i admire your ability to be independent i wish i could happily spend my friday nights alone without the feeling of fomo one suggestion you might give me to overcome my fomo is to look at technology and social media less i know that i need to take a step back from technology but that is easier said than done i am simply too obsessed and addicted to technology to cut technology and social media out of my life is nearly impossible another suggestion that i think is more feasible for me is to change my focus rather than focusing on not being there should i be happy for my friends and look forward to being at the next event with them is that your attitude i understand i need to see things in an optimistic way as opposed to being jealous i know you dont have similar feelings to me but my hope is that you can help change my mindset so that i dont constantly experience fomo i hope this letter finds you well and please help me beat fomo best abby,reddit,Unlabeled,0,2022-04-24T23:20:16,en,-9145273321244659351

i think that 13 reasons why is a very bad way of spreading awareness as the title suggests i think that 13rw is a very bad portrayal of mental health suicide depression etc and it shouldnt be promoted as a show that raises awareness when its just harmful it portrays suicide as something beautiful and meaningful and not what it really is and the whole blame it on other people even though they tried to help me thing nope nope nope thats so toxic idk if i just feel that way because of my ptsd an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because i didnt help him enough even though i did everything i could and was only 13 but its just not really how suicide should be portrayed in my opinion also the way they show flashbacks of hannah baker from when she was alive makes it seem like shes still alive in some way they reeeeally push this harmful suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people agenda when in reality suicide is often the exact opposite idk personally i really dont like that show and i think its harmful i once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend and she was all like who made you feel that way like it was other peoples fault like sure trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but i just dont feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way,reddit,Unlabeled,0,2020-05-05T16:51:39,en,3578466875465810216

just had my cousins memorial on zoom and it was atrocious my cousin recently killed herself we were close when we were growing up her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her expectations she obviously felt she couldnt meet im pissed off because in her memorial not once did they mention it was a suicide the closest thing i could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online where they said she succumbed to the pressures of covid19 which is the most bullshit way to sugarcoat a suicide they couldve come up with as someone who has been very very close to taking my own life having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didnt happen just sang songs about god beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to heaven and not hell even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed sin no recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life i posted on her memorial site just a quick blurb of some memories i had with her a nice photo of us when we were young and i quick sentence at the end basically saying some of us face our struggles silently and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone whether they ask for it or not and i linked nami and the suicide hotline they fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out they reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in im honestly appalled they seem embarrassed and ashamed of her and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the eyes of god fuck man wouldnt even let a supportive message and a link to nami slip in there had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever i feel so bad for her if her parents made me feel this invalidated in one fell swoop i cant imagine what her life was like with them just needed to vent thanks for reading,reddit,Unlabeled,0,2020-12-06T04:28:29,en,anonymous

since the video does not quite talk about how to recover from a burnout ill share with you my experience and how i am recovering im currently a student teenager and recently experienced a burnout it was horrible perhaps not as bad as yours but it was nonetheless bad my story its quite long but ill try to shorten it initially i was a relaxed student i finish my homework last minute and thats about it i did not do any extra studying i had and still have 2 tuition classes but they arent really helping then i met some really studious friends and a teacher who inspired me to study harder so thats what i did i searched up on ways to improve my life and when i got home each day i would spend more time studying i also did my homework in school so i could study at home results at the end of the school year was pretty decent and i improved a lot then came to the next year and i was keeping up the good pace but then i was met with a number of disappointments and problems studies family fights leadership roles friendship problems thats when i started having a burnout i stopped studying as hard and recently did horribly on my exams i cried for no reason multiple times and sometimes still do i would feel very lethargic and had more anxiety attacks i was not panicked when i have not finished my homework i didnt even bother doing last minute work i told nobody about any of this even though i really wanted to i have friends close friends and parents preferably my mom who i can confide in but i dont want to blow the situation up now comes the part when i realised i had a close friend the studious friend who was facing the exact same problem as me it was comforting to know that i was not alone in this if you are reading this i hope you know you are not alone either recovery i took time to write out my feelings especially when i feel down or have no one to talk to and that really helped because it feels like im being heard it also helps me to sort out my feeling and identify the problem trigger i started to study with my friend instead of doing it all by myself its comforting that she is going through the same thing as me but even if you cannot find anyone with the same issue you could study online study with me videos if you have an idol you like you could search up study with me videos with your idols in it organise your timetable it does not have to be very organised just make sure it has enough breaks short or long for you to rejuvenate and feel better its okay to cry i personally use crying as a way to relieve my stress im not sure if its a healthy thing to do but it really works i always either lock the room or go to the toilet for privacy but you can always confide in your crying buddy if you need to do whats suitable for yourself optional but you can take up meditation it personally really helps me to gather my thoughts and calm myself down i also have an offline playlist that plays anxietycalming music just incase i have an attack when im outdoors dont take up too much at once always space out your events classes and only take what you can handle theres no point taking up so many projects responsibilities and not being able to keep up in the end find someone you can confide in i know it might be hard especially if you have trust issues social anxiety is an introvert but it can be anyone your family close friends online friends just please make sure they at least trusted its much easier sharing the burden than carrying it all by yourself take time to heal find a hobby you enjoy or perhaps go on a vacation walk in the park whatever works for you try to do that at least once or twice everyweek try to time yourself so you dont end up eating into work time i learnt that studyingworking for 30minutes and taking a 5minutes break is really helpful during the 5min break try not to use your phone because thatll drive you offcourse i hope at least one of the tips here helped you if you even read this haha have a good day remember you are not alone in this if you need someone to talk to you but theres no one around you can talk to me reply on the comments stay safe buddy,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2021-09-12T09:44:09Z,en,@altacc3758

i argue how important it is that we heal the epidemic of burn out syndrome in america as it is one of the most crippling disorders a person can have and is affecting our societies and communities in a devastating way the primary reason why it is important to heal burn out among societal members is that there will be less isolation abuse of addictions and substances acts of aggression and social withdrawal and isolation among citizens often these causations lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms of many americans individually but on a larger scale lead to the breakdown of societies when individuals heal from such mental disorders they are able to be more intune with other peoples needs be more compassionate and be leaders this is essential for physicians working in the health care system it is especially important that doctors find treatment for burn out syndrome because the longer depressive symptoms go untreated the higher likelihood of the depression returning and hitting the person in a more severe and harmful way secondly it is important to heal burnout syndrome because healing means more improvement in a persons personal and professional life when a person heals from burnout syndrome they develop a more close knit relationship with their needs are more resilient and feel more accomplished like they have a purpose in their life as doctors are oftentimes working with sad cases it is essential that at least their personal and professional lives are working smoothly to cope with the compassion fatigue that so often healthcare professionals have healing this condition would cultivate a deeper knowledge and understanding of themselves and a kinder look on their own limitations this is essential as most doctors have perfectionistic personality types and are constantly beating themselves up unnecessarily making their job miserable and increasing their burn out symptoms thirdly as burn out increases the effectiveness their ability to stay engaged their morale and overall quality of work goes down although the effects of burnout are not numerically counted in the healthcare field the emotional toll and the quality of work is definitely felt amongst their patients when this is gone unchecked and untreated the body manifests it through often unexplained physical ailments such as constant fatigue aches pains sleep changes and other long term health issues such as heart disease or cancer i believe that we future doctors and physicians are so needed and the importance of healing burn out syndrome which often goes unnoticed is essential and cannot be understated may we protect ourselves and other doctors that we work amongst and bring this syndrome out in the open acknowledge it within ourselves and find healing and hope,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2023-04-26T02:18:36Z,en,@tyshields1074

you start to avoid activities that promote recall of the event or stressor this is so true for people who feel burnedout from work not only does this statement really resonated with me but i think it also shows how burnout and ptsd both cause similar symptoms i also agree that people who get burnedout at work are those who naturally are considered highlevel performers cause it takes a fire to leave you in a state of ashes if you get burnedout from work then you can no longer be the achiever that you once were cause you want to avoid the tramatic and stressful experience i feel like i got burnout after experiencing a stressful experience working on two projects with a total of 4 different supervisors and 1 new worker the 1 new worker basically had no business being in the business with his poor capabilities constantly making mistakes that i had to fix he also had an eq that resembled one of a child so he could not understand when i would really get sick and tired of his work quality one of the four supervisors was a slimeball of a human who took credit of my work while another did not push the project forward at all at her end while constantly making broken promises that she would another supervisor whom i started out respecting had disagreements with me on the projects direction where he would just not listen to my input as a result i had to work on a project that i believed was moving along a wrong route he eventually agreed with me on 1 of the 2 issues i had upon talking to an outside consultant proving that i was right for at least half of what i said i hope i can go back to my old self not to make this a long essay but my recommendations for anyone feeling burnout would be as follows 1 get your sleeping cycle in order this means going to bed early and having a full 7 to 8 hours of sound sleep trust me you will feel refreshed when you wake up 2 prioritize do things first which needs your attention the most 3 do not multitask our brains arent designed to multitask so stop doing it already and focus your attention on one work at one time youll perform much better this way 4 be a little conscientious try to keep your room tidy and things arranged properly 5 have a list of daily achievable goals and try to get those completed on the same day 6 keep away from social media as much as you can social media is like junk food for your brain 7 be thankful for what you have if you are reading this trust me you are truly lucky and have much more resources at your disposal than at least half of the worlds population last i must say however i do not wish to agree with the great speakers 2year recovery period generalization or story of getting cancer these need not apply to everyone,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2022-11-08T05:13:26Z,en,@weareall1

my wife said that this is wrong about caring and loving for someone with burnout im the one with burnout i thought this video would help her to understand but it didnt unfortunately i feel i struggle alone when i hit burnout oh welllife can be like that so i try to be kind and gentle to myself as well as i can be i appreciate your efforts and awareness on this video and in no way i am putting my wife down not everyone is going to understand this as some people think just push yourself but burnout is beyond that i explained to my wife and i think she struggled to comprehend it so not everyone is going to understand unless they have burnout themselves she sees that when im burnout im depressed dysregulated and shes scared of me even though all i want is a warm loving hug i can understand how she feels though because i used to drink to cope and my behaviour wasnt the best ive stopped drinking a while now but i think that fear is still there i guess its something that we both need to work on and i know its going to take time but its me who wants to work on this more rather than my wife as its really my issue with the burnout and wanting that love where ill be in bed all day and i wont be checked on once whilst shes happily watching netflix all day when you are so burned out its zero energy even to ask for a hug unfortunately and this is the sad thing she says shes not a mind reader knowing when i want a hug and i should go to her but when my batteries are completely gone there is no energy to go to her or send a message or call i cant do absolutely nothing and struggle for hours any advice i know that this is a tricky one,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2023-09-15T21:24:24Z,en,@LYRIKALMASTER

the way angelo shared his journey with depression is a powerful reminder of the importance the need of open conversations around mental health especially in breaking the cycle of keeping it to oneself that prevents people from helping us what hit me hard was when you described feeling isolated despite having fun with your friends or family no one notices it because we can hide it with a smile just like angelo did because we think that if we ask for help from them were afraid that they will invalidate us and its good to see how you found strength through family and professional help id like to add the importance of taking simple steps toward healing just like you said in your story its okay to progress slowly rather than having no progress at all what matters is that you fight it and never give up for those who are watching if youre experiencing the same thing angelo did dont be afraid to seek help from your friends and family its not a weakness to seek help but its the strongest thing you can do another thing that can save you help is available line call 09663514518 in the ph offering 247 support im thankful that i found this video contents like this remind us that were not alone and that seeking help is the key to defeat depression,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2024-11-15T14:17:51Z,en,@JamesEsperon-j4y

having depression is one of the most torturous things in life it changed my whole person after many years i think i havent recovered much of who i was before depression my family didnt support me or maybe they didnt know how to deal with me and my emotions the only person who was with me during my dark days was my litle brother he was just 9 years old but he was smart enough to see that something wrong was happening to me he did his best to help me he used to watch tv by my side to secure i had a good time but of course nothing could take away this thing to me my mind couldnt stop i learned how to live with it and how to hide my feelings i lost my way and i did things that now i regret i had to work a lot with myself i searched for professional help and now i feel better,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2021-07-26T22:14:41Z,en,@gabrielagonzalez6577

no offense but nowadays people say that young generation find it cool to be depressed but its not true few people do but not everyone i would say youngsters mostly as their number is more they have many reasons and i noticed that even parents also make thing more exagerating nowadays youngsters mental health is easy to trigger which make it even hard and studies too i agree that everyone study hard but we should cut some slack or introduce good techniques rather than forcing or stressing and these things cause to depression anxiety and attraction towards drugs and alcohol and stuff even though these reasons are not enough to be depressed but as i mentioned they get targeted easily so we should support them instead of comparing their state to others,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2025-02-01T17:28:06Z,en,@PraptiJadhav-jv6gb

yes the bible says to pray about everything no matter what we are going through right now no matter how impossible the situation may seem no matter how helpless or hopeless we may feel we should remember this nothing is impossible with god gods power is infinite therefore we should have faith in him his power and his love for us i encourage you to go to god in prayer take this time to pursue god for and foremost ask god to protect comfort guide and strength you through this trial it will only weigh on your mind more and more and potentially miss out on the spiritual benefits of seeking guidance and comfort if you neglect to pray before the lord we are to give our grievances our emotional turmoil our anguish to god our peace is not determined by our circumstances our peace is dependent upon our relationship with god the closer that we are to god the more peaceful we are practicing discipline with your mental state to surrender your issues to jesus christ is something god desperately wants from you do not lean on your own understanding but just trust in jesus christ he is the only answer to all your problems he knows you completely and knows your pain too and he will heal your heart and will pour his blessings upon you now its up to you to repent and put your trust in jesus let him lead you strive towards being satisfied with god because if he cant satisfy you how can any person jesus said in matthew 1128 come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest philippians 467 states be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through christ jesus,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2025-01-27T18:33:30Z,en,@loveandfaithfulness4479

i understand the sentiment behind this but frankly i found so many logical problems with this mentality over the years to the point where when someone starts telling me things like this i just shut them down immediately because im tired of hearing the cliche for a brief clarification saying that i cant compare myself to other people whether they are higher on the ladder or lower on the ladder is actually very damaging to any sort of objective analysis if you want to become a master furniture maker youre going to have to compare your work towards someone who already is a master furniture maker even more so if that person is literally teaching you how to do it if you know people who have the type of success that you want to have you have to compare yourself to them otherwise how are you supposed to know when you are achieving similar results yes you can do it too much and it becomes a toxic exchange but it doesnt necessarily have to be that way making a blanket statement that comparison is always negative is extremely shortsighted and onedimensional people tell me that i dont have it so bad because theres other people that have it worse than me no one seems to have a problem pushing that type of onesided comparison seems a bit hypocritical to me even more interestingly enough i would say that comparison is actually less valuable considering i think theres a larger canyon between those who have virtually nothing and those that have a little bit of something compared to those who have something and just want to get a little bit more im not so stupid as to compare myself to literal hollywood grade movie stars im comparing myself to some joe on the street who looks way better than i do and dresses a little bit better and actually has a woman on his hip that isnt some monumental chasm thats just some normal guy who is doing the things that i want to do and therefore quite manageable as an expectation,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2025-03-06T15:27:13Z,en,@mr.m2914

so in essence dont compare yourselves to the versions of people and their lives that are presented to you on any media those are unfair because youre comparing a crafted version of someone else with your real version to make this a fair contest youd first have to craft a superior version of yourselves and compare that version to the fake version of the other person but then youd realize how useless this type of comparison is because you could make up anything about yourselves and thus win any contest with almost zero effort only problem is that its not real instead a more healthy way would be to compare yourselves with people who you are in direct contact with and whose lives you can perceive more directly like the ones belonging to your inner social circle thats not just digital,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2024-10-15T11:12:32Z,en,@lollekompolle

what hurts about upwards comparisons is that regardless of any uncontrollable variable accounted for that the fact that person is still above me it doesnt matter if they got it through similar quicker or less lucky means that you did but that they managed to get to a point in which youre envious of they get more recognition skills and possibly a better living situation because of those skills and you are left with your situation to put salt in the wound you cant just accept that you simply wont be at their level and that even if you did they would already be at a bigger better point its like accepting your mediocrityyou want to be at their level and you want to improve alongside them you dont want to be as good as famous person a or successful person b you want to be able to feel like i can carry my own weight in an interpersonal relationship whether itd be with my friends or my family the fact of the matter is that theres a possibility of losing those relationships naturally because of a failure to improve and adapt to that is scary even the nicest people cant stand to wait for their peers because everyone is on their own journey in life they need to move on and improve themselves if you cant reach that point especially by your 20s30s then as you stagnate people will rather seek out interpersonal relationships that are substantial for their socialfinancialideological needs in that current moment as a result what youre left with is an underdeveloped mediocre and shallow skill set and an undeniable sense of loneliness from lack of people who are interested,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2024-10-04T09:00:44Z,en,@thesteelshow433

be anxious for nothing christians battle anxiety even jesus was anxious at gethsemane he fought through his fears and surrendered to him it is gods will for us to have a life of calm not chaos of peace not panic train your heart to be anxious for nothing anxiety comes with life but it does not have to dominate your life it comes from a place of powerlessness when were not sure of the outcome of something when you know the outcome fear and anxiety goes now our outcome as christians is my god provideth the pathway out of the valley of fret is in philippians 4 rejoice in the lord always i will say it again rejoice let your graciousness be known to everyone the lord is near dont worry about anything but in everything through prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in christ jesus philippians 447 csb 1 celebrate the lords goodness rejoice in the lord always dont meditate on the mess the more you stare at the problem the bigger it gets lift up your eyes i will lift up my eyes to the hills where does my help come from its a decision to focus on christ focus on god is god bigger than this problem does god have solutions has he gotten me out of this type of thing before is he still on the throne does he have a track record 2 ask god for help make your requests known ask and you will receive the path to peace is always paved with prayer thats why the devil doesnt want us to pray 3 now after praying replace your anxiety with gratitude they cannot coexist next time youre anxious begin to make a list of things to which youre grateful 4 meditate on good things you cant control the circumstances but you can control how you think about them peace comes from a stream of thinking when you remember what god says he will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory today i will live today remember that it is not gods will for you to be anxious,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2024-08-09T03:36:09Z,en,@healthywithdrdee

this was one of the most ignorant videos ive ever seen i had to watch this in new employee orientation i do believe our social interactions relationships if positive definitely help us manage lifes toughest seasons serving others caring giving etc also has the same effects perspective definitely is key as well but it depends on the situation we can tell ourselves we arent really stressed be optimistic positive etc but in many circumstances that will not change reality the effects of stress are very real on the physical mental health as well as how it impacts our relationships job performance sometimes you just have to face reality change things in your life wether that be associations your employer saying no not over extending yourself going to bed early staying off social media eating healthier etc doing daily practical things to live a healthy well balanced life we cant be or do it all keep trying see how fast your life falls apart from the stress of it all if its in our control to change things for the better in our life then do it you can change your perception but it doesnt mean itll change reality you still have circumstances that need to be addressed no matter how you view them sometimes we have stressors that do challenge us help us grow in these circumstances yes perception is key but her methodology will not work in other scenarios in americapeople are stressed because they take on to much,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2025-03-18T00:38:08Z,en,@onewomansjourney760

when you have stress so hard to relieve you feel as if you have a boss with the following conflictstraits the boss insists you work for 140 hours a week for more than a few years without any daysoff otherwise he threatens to kill you for sure whoever overhears the threat calls the cops and the cops try shooting him but every bullet bounces off of him and back at the cops because the boss has 200 armor for flesh and therefore takes no physical damage whatsoever and therefore also destroys sharp weapons and stingers of stinging insects and even breaks hard heavy objects and any wild animals teeth and claws he immediately destroys handcuffs for the same reason then the cops and neighbors try scaring the boss but nothing scares him because fury is literally his only emotion when trying to outrun him he always runs faster unless he gets tired and therefore needs sleep but he only sleeps for at most 2 hours in every 24hour period and is a seriously light sleeper so even the quietest noise ever can wake him and it takes him too long to get back to sleep,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2024-03-21T23:36:23Z,en,@cbsteffen

i was really surprised about some of the information i found out in the video i didnt realize the drastic physical effects that stress has on the body i do notice that i tend to get sick when i am stressed out so when the video confirmed that the immune system struggles when it is out under drastic stress it also scares me that it had also been linked to cancer and other health risks like that i also realized that making lists and having them never end can also be a stress causer rather than a stress reliever it also helps to know that it isnt just me feeling all the symptoms knowing that this is common with everyone makes it easier to deal with some of the things that stress me out most in life are my future and school i get really worried about how my future will play out and i am concerned that i will end up being unhappy in my future life it effects me a lot because it makes me stay up at night and it prevents me from having fun now because i am worried about where i will end up i also stress a lot about school because it has been drilled into my brain from a young age that i need to be my absolute best all the time it really affects me because i feel like i have a never ending pressure on me to do well normally i cope by doing all my work at once then i can feel a little better when my checklist is empty,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2022-02-28T03:51:24Z,en,@graceboo3124

what ive learned is living in todays day getting a job in the city your gonna have alot of stress but if you live out in the farms and grow your own food and make everything yourself you wont have nearly as much stress i feel like the perfect balance is finding a mixture of the two meaning dont just buy everything make some things too so your not spending as much money though you would be working harder and spending more time i feel like it would be worth it,youtube,Unlabeled,0,2021-12-16T08:53:21Z,en,@ramonowens8957
