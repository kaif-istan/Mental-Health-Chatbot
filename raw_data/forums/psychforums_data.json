      "The Depression (Major Depressive Disorder) Forum is for the discussion of Depression and related topics. Please remember that children may be reading this particular forum and post appropriately. Major Depressive Disorder Description Major depressive disorder (also known as recurrent depressive disorder, clinical depression, major depression, unipolar depression, or unipolar disorder) is a mental disorder characterized by an all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low self-esteem, and by loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. The term \"major depressive disorder\" was selected by the American Psychiatric Association to designate this symptom cluster as a mood disorder in the 1980 version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), and has become widely used since. The general term depression is often used to denote the disorder; but as it can also be used in reference to other types of psychological depression, it is disfavored over more precise terminology for the disorder in clinical and research use. Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, around 3.4% of people with major depression commit suicide, and up to 60% of people who commit suicide had depression or another mood disorder. Major Depressive Disorder DSM IV-TR Criteria Code: Select all Major Depressive Episode A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note:  Do note include symptoms that are clearly due to a general medical condition, or mood-incongruent delusions or hallucinations. (1) depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood. (2) markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others) (3) significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gains. (4) insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day (5) psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down) (6) fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day (7) feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick) (8) diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others) (9) recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide B. The symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode. C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism). E. The symptoms are not better accounted for by Bereavement, i.e., after the loss of a loved one, the symptoms persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation. Single Episode A.  Presence of a single Major Depressive Episode B.  The Major Depressive Episode is not better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder and is not superimposed on Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform Disorder, Delusional Disorder, or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. C. There has never been a Manic Episode, a Mixed Episode, or a Hypomanic Episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like, mixed-like, or hypomanic-like episodes are substance or treatment induced or are due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition. Major Depressive Disorder Recurrent A.  Presence of two or more Major Depressive Episodes. Note: To be considered separate episodes, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months in which criteria are not met for a Major Depressive Episode. B.   The Major Depressive Episodes are not better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder and are not superimposed on Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform Disorder, Delusional Disorder, or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. C.  There has never been a Manic Episode, a Mixed Episode, or a Hypomanic Episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like, mixed-like, or hypomanic-like episodes are substance or treatment induced or are due to the direct physiological effects or a general medical condition. Specify (for current or most recent episode): Severity/Psychotic/Remission Specifiers Chronic With Catatonic Features With Atypical Features With Postpartum Onset Specify Longitudinal Course Specifiers (With and Without Interepisode Recovery) With Seasonal Pattern American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. (c) 2000 American Psychiatric Association. http://www.psych.org/ ADHD ICD-10 Criteria Code: Select all F33 Recurrent Depressive Disorder The disorder is characterized by repeated episodes of depression as specified in depressive episode (mild, moderate, or severe), without any history of independent episodes of mood elevation and overactivity that fulfill the criteria of mania. However, the category should still be used if there is evidence of brief episodes of mild mood elevation and overactivity which fulfill the criteria of hypomania immediately after a depressive episode (sometimes apparently precipitated by treatment of a depression). The age of onset and the severity, duration, and frequency of the episodes of depression are all highly variable. In general, the first episode occurs later than in bipolar disorder, with a mean age of onset in the fifth decade. Individual episodes also last between 3 and 12 months (median duration about 6 months) but recur less frequently. Recovery is usually complete between episodes, but a minority of patients may develop a persistent depression, mainly in old age (for which this category should still be used). Individual episodes of any severity are often precipitated by stressful life events; in many cultures, both individual episodes and persistent depression are twice as common in women as in men. The risk that a patient with recurrent depressive disorder will have an episode of mania never disappears completely, however many depressive episodes he or she has experienced. If a manic episode does occur, the diagnosis should change to bipolar affective disorder. Recurrent depressive episode may be subdivided, as below, by specifying first the type of the current episode and then (if sufficient information is available) the type that predominates in all the episodes. Includes: recurrent episodes of depressive reaction, psychogenic depression, reactive depression, seasonal affective disorder recurrent episodes of endogenous depression, major depression, manic depressive psychosis (depressed type), psychogenic or reactive depressive psychosis, psychotic depression, vital depression Excludes: recurrent brief depressive episodes F32 Depressive Episode In typical depressive episodes of all three varieties described below (mild, moderate, and severe), the individual usually suffers from depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to increased fatiguability and diminished activity. Marked tiredness after only slight effort is common. Other common symptoms are: reduced concentration and attention; reduced self-esteem and self-confidence; ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode); bleak and pessimistic views of the future; ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide; disturbed sleep; diminished appetite. The lowered mood varies little from day to day, and is often unresponsive to circumstances, yet may show a characteristic diurnal variation as the day goes on. As with manic episodes, the clinical presentation shows marked individual variations, and atypical presentations are particularly common in adolescence. In some cases, anxiety, distress, and motor agitation may be more prominent at times than the depression, and the mood change may also be masked by added features such as irritability, excessive consumption of alcohol, histrionic behaviour, and exacerbation of pre-existing phobic or obsessional symptoms, or by hypochondriacal preoccupations. For depressive episodes of all three grades of severity, a duration of at least 2 weeks is usually required for diagnosis, but shorter periods may be reasonable if symptoms are unusually severe and of rapid onset. Some of the above symptoms may be marked and develop characteristic features that are widely regarded as having special clinical significance. The most typical examples of these \"somatic\" symptoms are: loss of interest or pleasure in activities that are normally enjoyable; lack of emotional reactivity to normally pleasurable surroundings and events; waking in the morning 2 hours or more before the usual time; depression worse in the morning; objective evidence of definite psychomotor retardation or agitation (remarked on or reported by other people); marked loss of appetite; weight loss (often defined as 5% or more of body weight in the past month); marked loss of libido. Usually, this somatic syndrome is not regarded as present unless about four of these symptoms are definitely present. The categories of mild, moderate and severe depressive episodes described in more detail below should be used only for a single (first) depressive episode. Further depressive episodes should be classified under one of the subdivisions of recurrent depressive disorder. These grades of severity are specified to cover a wide range of clinical states that are encountered in different types of psychiatric practice. Individuals with mild depressive episodes are common in primary care and general medical settings, whereas psychiatric inpatient units deal largely with patients suffering from the severe grades. Acts of self-harm associated with mood (affective) disorders, most commonly self-poisoning by prescribed medication, should be recorded by means of an additional code from Chapter XX of ICD-10 (X60-X84). These codes do not involve differentiation between attempted suicide and \"parasuicide\", since both are included in the general category of self-harm. Differentiation between mild, moderate, and severe depressive episodes rests upon a complicated clinical judgement that involves the number, type, and severity of symptoms present. The extent of ordinary social and work activities is often a useful general guide to the likely degree of severity of the episode, but individual, social, and cultural influences that disrupt a smooth relationship between severity of symptoms and social performance are sufficiently common and powerful to make it unwise to include social performance amongst the essential criteria of severity. The presence of dementia or mental retardation does not rule out the diagnosis of a treatable depressive episode, but communication difficulties are likely to make it necessary to rely more than usual for the diagnosis upon objectively observed somatic symptoms, such as psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite and weight, and sleep disturbance. Includes: single episodes of depression (without psychotic symptoms), psychogenic depression or reactive depression) F32.0 Mild Depressive Episode Diagnostic Guidelines Depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and increased fatiguability are usually regarded as the most typical symptoms of depression, and at least two of these, plus at least two of the other symptoms described above should usually be present for a definite diagnosis. None of the symptoms should be present to an intense degree. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. An individual with a mild depressive episode is usually distressed by the symptoms and has some difficulty in continuing with ordinary work and social activities, but will probably not cease to function completely. A fifth character may be used to specify the presence of the somatic syndrome: F32.00 Without somatic symptoms The criteria for mild depressive episode are fulfilled, and there are few or none of the somatic symptoms present. F32.01 With somatic symptoms The criteria for mild depressive episode are fulfilled, and four or more of the somatic symptoms are also present. (If only two or three somatic symptoms are present but they are unusually severe, use of this category may be justified.) F32.1 Moderate Depressive Episode Diagnostic Guidelines At least two of the three most typical symptoms noted for mild depressive episode should be present, plus at least three (and preferably four) of the other symptoms. Several symptoms are likely to be present to a marked degree, but this is not essential if a particularly wide variety of symptoms is present overall. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. An individual with a moderately severe depressive episode will usually have considerable difficulty in continuing with social, work or domestic activities. A fifth character may be used to specify the occurrence of somatic symptoms: F32.10 Without somatic symptoms The criteria for moderate depressive episode are fulfilled, and few if any of the somatic symptoms are present. F32.11 With somatic symptoms The criteria for moderate depressive episode are fulfilled, and four or more or the somatic symptoms are present. (If only two or three somatic symptoms are present but they are unusually severe, use of this category may be justified.) F32.2 Severe Depressive Episode Without Psychotic Symptoms In a severe depressive episode, the sufferer usually shows considerable distress or agitation, unless retardation is a marked feature. Loss of self-esteem or feelings of uselessness or guilt are likely to be prominent, and suicide is a distinct danger in particularly severe cases. It is presumed here that the somatic syndrome will almost always be present in a severe depressive episode. Diagnostic Guidelines All three of the typical symptoms noted for mild and moderate depressive episodes should be present, plus at least four other symptoms, some of which should be of severe intensity. However, if important symptoms such as agitation or retardation are marked, the patient may be unwilling or unable to describe many symptoms in detail. An overall grading of severe episode may still be justified in such instances. The depressive episode should usually last at least 2 weeks, but if the symptoms are particularly severe and of very rapid onset, it may be justified to make this diagnosis after less than 2 weeks. During a severe depressive episode it is very unlikely that the sufferer will be able to continue with social, work, or domestic activities, except to a very limited extent. This category should be used only for single episodes of severe depression without psychotic symptoms; for further episodes, a subcategory of recurrent depressive disorder should be used. Includes: single episodes of agitated depression, melancholia or vital depression without psychotic symptoms F32.3 Severe Depressive Episode With Psychotic Symptoms Diagnostic Guidelines A severe depressive episode which meets the criteria given for severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms and in which delusions, hallucinations, or depressive stupor are present. The delusions usually involve ideas of sin, poverty, or imminent disasters, responsibility for which may be assumed by the patient. Auditory or olfactory hallucinations are usually of defamatory or accusatory voices or of rotting filth or decomposing flesh. Severe psychomotor retardation may progress to stupor. If required, delusions or hallucinations may be specified as mood-congruent or mood-incongruent. Differential Diagnosis Depressive stupor must be differentiated from catatonic schizophrenia, from dissociative stupor, and from organic forms of stupor. This category should be used only for single episodes of severe depression with psychotic symptoms; for further episodes a subcategory of recurrent depressive disorder should be used. Includes: single episodes of major depression with psychotic symptoms, psychotic depression, psychogenic depressive psychosis, reactive depressive psychosis International Classification of Diseases (ICD), World Health Organization http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/",

      "Here is a book that I just read and found helpful for depression and bipolar disorder. Allen, J. 2006. Coping with Depression From Catch-22 to Hope. American Psychiatric Publishing, DC Excellent survey of the latest ideas and theories about depression. The book contains up-to-date research with over 500 literature citations throughout the text. In contrast to some experts, the author believes that mood changes are not just due to a single neurotransmitter (such as serotonin). Rather the increase in synaptice levels of neurochemical levels leads to a cascade of changes in the neurons. Cognitive therapy was pointed out to be an effective, proven method of dealing with depression. This therapy involves identifying automatic negative thoughts, challenging them, examining the evidence for the thoughts, and brainstorming for other alternatives. Among the best strategies for getting yourself out of a bad mood is to exercise. Regular aerobic exercise at 70% maximum heart rate seems best. Manic episodes in polar depression can be brought on by sleep schedule disruption. Also, positive life events like a promotion or new romance can trigger mania. This notion goes along with my struggles with polar. The times I've experienced a mania phase have been times of major achievemnet. If you want the lastest ideas about depression, this is the book for you.",
      "Spark your Dream by Candelaria and Herman Zapp ISBN:978-987-23134-1-8 Spark your Dream by Candelaria and Herman Zapp is the true story of two young people who traveled from Arrgentina to Alaska in a very old car.  Along the way they encountered many problems, but with the help of hundreds of people in many countries they finished their journey and had a child along the way. Good hearted people gave them food, places to stay, and helped them repair their car.  Reading this excdllent book will restore your faith in people's willingness to share.  Depressed people often do not have must trust in their fellows.  This book will help one get a more positive view of the world. They concluded that the hardest part of this multi-year trek was getting started.  That's how most projects seem to be.  If you want something, but keep putting it off you might experience depression because you are not being true to yourself. Reading the book made me think that perhaps if more of us chased our dreams we would need less pills for depression and less illegal drugs to boast our happiness.  Their story would make a great movie.  Depression often brings feelings of being hopeless with no choice but more and more misery.  Going after your dreams will help you become in control of your life.  Read this book to build up your hope. James",
      "This book was helpful for me to see how my childhood affected me.  It also gave me a number of things to try to fight my mood swings. Bradshaw, J. 1988. Healing the Shame that Binds You.  Health Communications, Deerfield Beach, Florida John Bradshaw's book is full of references to various philosphies and methods of treating psychological problems.  He expalins how many of our difficulties relate to how we were made to feel unworthy of love. I especially enjoyed how he described the work of Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck.  Thinking that we should be perfect or that we know what someone is thinking can lead us into depression. John Bradshaw goes from quoting famous people to mentioning the simple praises that are heard in 12-step meetings.  So people who attend 12-step meetings are likely to get a lot from this book.",
      "Here are comments about a book I just read:  Surviving Ben's Suicide by C. Comfort Shields Comfort Shields shares her painful feelings connected with her boyfriend's death in Surviving Ben's Suicide.  The book does not give general information and statistics about suicide or depression.  Rather, it is a compilation of memores pondered over with the hope of gaining understanding.  Much of the book details pleasent memories of a college romance, which most of us can relate to.  At first, Ben seemed so wonderful, however, hints of a dark side became apparent after Comfort looked at events from the perspective of years.  As is typical when someone close to us commits suicide, the author wrestles with heavy questions:  Why did it happen?  Could I have prevented the act?  What made me be attracted to such a person?  Is there something wrong with me?  Comfort recalls and sometimes agonizes over conversations, interactions, and other observations from the past.  Writing this memoir enabled the author to grow past the experience.  In the end, she concludes that she will never know the real answers to her questions, but that she has to just move on with life.  The book is well written; once one begins reading it, one can't put it down. The book can be particulary useful to several groups of people.  Of course all people who have been through a similar experience will realize that they are not alone with their questions and preoocupations.  But another group who might benefit greatly are those who have mood swings--those with clinical depression or bipolar disorder.  Often these people contemplate suicide, but fail to realize how deeply their death will affect others.  This book shows that a person is affected for a long time when a friend takes his/her own life.  Maybe by reading this book, people will think twice about the option of suicide. Suicide is common, but it is not easily understood.  Ben was treated by a number of doctors and with a variety of medications.  Our medical profession was unable to save Comfort's boyfriend. In the end, Comfort discovered that we can not always solve life's mysteries.  At times, we just have to let go and move on.  It is painful, but remains the only alternative.  Epictetus once said, \"It is not things that disturb people but their judgements about things.\"  The author with her searching and speculating has found some good in the awful event of Ben's suicide.  In the end, she wrote that she came out with more strength and tenderness.   At times Comfort seemed to blame herself, but on the other hand, just maybe, Ben's time with Comfort may have been the the best time of his life.  We want to think that we can say magic words to save someone from depression, but maybe no such words exist.  Maybe some depressions can not be helped.  If the doctors with their arsenal of powerful drugs could not help Ben, what makes a person think she can do better.  But we still try.  Thank God we still try.",
      "I enjoyed this book and thought it helpful. Jim S Depression for Dummies by L. Smith and C. Elliott, 2003. The authors, two clinical psychologists, have done an excellent job in describing many methods of fighting depression.  Unlike some books, the emphesis is on alternative therapies and talking treatments like cognitive therapy, rather than just finding the right combination of pills.  However, the various medications for depression are listed, classified, and explained.  Ideas used by 12-step programs like acceptance, gratitude, and helping others are noted.  Many studies have proved that exercise is useful for treating depression.  This book devotes an entire chapter to starting an exercise program.  Much of the book deals with wrestling with the thinking distortions common in depressed folk.  Depressed people tend to search for bad news and the negative side of things.  They fail to notice the positive or argue it away.  They jump to major conclusions about the future and what people are thinking.  Winning over the power of a low mood often requires one to methodically sort through one's beliefs. This is the best book for getting an comprehensive view of the many ways of conquering depression.  Every person suffering from low moods should read this book before accepting that pills are their only option.",
      "This book opened my eyes about expecting happiness from a pill. Jim S Before Prozac by E. Shorter.  2009. Oxford University Press, NY NY In Before Prozac the author covers the history of antidepressant medication in a very detailed manner.  To support his ideas, there are 58 pages of notes and references in the back of the book.  He supplies many reliable references concerning the poor performance of Prozac.  Prozac is popular because of the amount of marketing, not for its ability to lift depression.  Other drugs developed in the 1950's were far better.  In 6 of 8 studies presented to the FDA, Prozac failed conviningly to beat the placebo.  Lilly, the company marketing Prozac, failed to even notice that the drug produces sexual dysfunction.  Later they grudgingly acknowledged sexual problems occured in under 1% of patients.  Eventually they acknowledged the rate was 30%, but doctors prescribing Prozac say the true number is 80-90%.  So, in summary, the author shows that Prozac is not very effective for depression, and its use will take away the joy of sex.  Much of the book is tedious, but the last few chapters are interesting and revealing.  Contrary to commercials, the book quotes experts who state that we do not really understand how antidepressants work.  The brain is just not very simple.  If you want to find out the facts about the drug industry, read this book.  Your eyes will be opened. The authors discoveries about the FDA are shocking to say the least.  Today, the FDA does not want new drugs tested against old ones, only against placebos.  As a result new drug formulations are often not as good as the old, but they are far more expensive.  At one point the FDA got rid of thousands of drugs that many doctors believed worked.",
      "Interesting about Prozac, I've been taking this drug for three months and have seen no improvement. I haven't noticed any loss of sex drive, but loss of libido is a concern as is hair loss which I've also known can be linked to these drugs. I've actually decided to come off these drugs, they're doing nothing for me, maybe a danger in the long run."

      "THE first thing to realise when looking at self help for depression is that the very nature of depression can make self help difficult. In this case, your best option is to get help from a trained professional. However, if you feel up to helping yourself, here is a comprehensive list of what you need to do. 1.Get a good understanding of what depression is. Self help for depression is much more effective once you know what you are dealing with. Ensure you know clearly what is going on. 2.Regulate your sleep patterns. Get up no later than 8am and go to bed no later than 11.30pm, even if you can't sleep. If you have problems getting up in the morning, get someone else to rouse you, or have a friend call. 3.Eat 3 meals a day, whether you are hungry or not, at the right times. 4.Ensure you get outside early to make sure you get enough bright light to help regulate your sleep patterns. 5.Do things to occupy your mind. If you have nothing to do all day, you will tend to ruminate over your problems. 6.If you are facing a big problem, make the decision to put off thinking about it for, say, 2 weeks, or whatever is appropriate in your case. If you cannot put it off, speak to someone else who you know to be a good practical problem solver. 7.Begin a 'depression diary'. In this rate each day from 1 to 10, where 1 is the worst kind of day, and 10 the best. This will help break down the 'all or nothing' thinking that depression can cause. 8.Get as much exercise as you can. Make yourself walk briskly every day, at least. If you have any concerns about your health, see your doctor before beginning this. Research shows that exercise can lift depression. 9.Get some kind of relaxation during the day. If you know how to do meditation, self hypnosis, tai chi or some other mind-calming technique, do it. It will help reduce the physical effects of the depression greatly. 10.Start challenging your own thinking about things. If you find yourself thinking about things in a depressive way, deliberately think in a new way. A good way to do this is to write down the original thought, and then generate some alternatives. 11.Understand that depression is not part of you; it is due to a set of symptoms. These symptoms cause you to feel, think and act differently to normal. Once depression goes, things will be different. And when you have the skills to beat it, it is more likely to stay away. 12.Supplement your diet with pure high grade epa fish oil, this has been proven to help many people. 13.seek nutritional advise to ensure that your diet is properly balanced. Self help for depression can be difficult. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Once you have beaten it, you can help others.",

I am in the middle of a major depression right now, but got to the computer today and made myself do some surfing.  Thanks to one of the links, (Jim) I am hoping to attend a Recovery, Inc meeting tomorrow.  I went a few times about 15 years ago, but will give it another try.  It lightened my mood considerably to read of others with the same problems; certainly I don't wish depression on anyone, nor am I glad to read of other's suffering, but its such a lift to read about those who have been there and are fighting this.  In some cases where folks have emerged from the tunnel of darkness, there is hope and consolation. I would add to the list of helpful activities the following: meaningful and fulfilling work/hobbies.  I had a very fulfilling job as a case manager for the past 8 years - I had to leave this January due to burnout, stress and severe depression.  Now that I have left I am even more depressed.  Fulfilling work can really help to manage depressive symptoms - it can get you out of yourself and leave you too busy for rumination and apathy. Sorry for the long and rambling post... I am feeling lonely and somewhat hopeless and needed to reach out.  All the best to us all. Eileen",

      "Since I suffer from SAD and have been for about 8 years now I thought this would be a good time to post some info on this because the days are starting to get shorter. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs at the same time each year (usually winter) for at least 2 years in a row. It sometimes is called the \"winter blues\" because most people with seasonal affective disorder have an episode of depression during the winter months, although it is possible to experience SAD during summer months. SAD consists of four central features: Recurring major depressive episodes that begin around the same time each year (usually in September or October) and end around the same time each year (usually in April or May) Full recovery from the symptoms during \"nonseasonal\" months (usually May through August) Depressive episodes that occur during the same time of year for 2 consecutive years Over the lifetime course of the illness, more depressive episodes during winter months than summer months People with SAD who have episodes of depression in the winter usually live in areas far north of the equator, where there are shorter days in the winter months (such as Alaska and other northern states in the United States, as well as Canada and Scandinavian countries). They begin to get symptoms of depression in the fall, need treatment throughout the winter, and get better in the spring and summer as the days lengthen. Less is known about seasonal affective disorder in which episodes of depression occur in the summer. Symptoms of summer SAD usually appear in late spring or early summer and resolve in the fall. Summer SAD may be related to excessive heat rather than a lack of light. A person with summer SAD may be irritable or have no energy. The specific cause of SAD is not clearly understood. However, lack of sunlight caused by the shorter and darker days of winter, darkened or indoor working places, and long cloudy spells have been linked to episodes of depression in people with SAD. Some experts think SAD may be caused by a disturbance in circadian rhythms or problems with the regulation of a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called serotonin. SAD can be difficult to distinguish from major depression. A family history of SAD increases the risk of developing SAD. While there is no known cure for SAD, the depressive episodes of SAD can be managed effectively with medications, counseling, light therapy, or a combination of these. Treatment of SAD's Treatment studies of light therapy have shown increasingly rigorous methodology with larger sample sizes, less diagnostic heterogeneity, longer treatment periods, and parallel instead of crossover designs. Wavelength of light used in light therapy was examined in two studies. In one study, the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum did not add to the therapeutic efficacy of light therapy. Because of the potential harmful effects of long-term W exposure, light therapy devices should have W filters that block wavelengths below 400 nm. In a comparison light box study, cool-white fluorescent lights were as effective as full-spectrum fluorescent lights, adding evidence to other studies showing that various light sources (including incandescent lights) are effective for treating SAD. Devices other than light boxes were also studied for light therapy. Two recent studies, with the largest sample sizes in light therapy studies to date, used a light visor. In both studies, there was no relationship between the intensity of light and various measures of response to treatment, despite the fact that very low intensity light (60 lux) was used. This contrasts to most light box studies where a dear intensity-response relationship is found. Several explanations may explain this discrepancy. The proximity of the visor light source to the eye may increase the amount of light that reaches the retina, as compared to a light box. Lux, a unit of illumination, may also not be the best measure of the biologic or therapeutic effect of light. There is increasing evidence that even low illumination can affect biologic parameters, so that for some patients, light as low as 100 lux may be therapeutically effective. Finally, although the response rate was high in both studies (over 60% by strictly defined criteria), a non-specific (placebo) effect of light therapy must also be considered. In this regard, a light box study by Eastman and associates using a non-light control condition (a negative ion generator that, unknown to subjects, was turned off), found no differences between the control condition and bright light treatment (7000 lux for 1 hour in the morning). However, the response rate for the bright light condition (29%) was unusually low compared to other treatment studies. The selection criteria and unusually sunny weather during the course of their study may have excluded more light-responsive patients. Thus, the issue of placebo effects in light therapy remains unresolved. The Seattle group conducted a series of studies investigating dawn simulation in SAD. Dawn simulation uses a device that gradually increases illumination exposure, while the patient is sleeping, to simulate a summer dawn during the winter. Significant improvement occurred using dawn simulation compared to various control conditions, despite a final illumination as low as 250 lux. Two groups studying predictors for light therapy found that hypersomnia and hyperphagia predicted clinical response. Another study, however, reported that only high consumption of sweets in the latter half of the day predicted response to treatment. Of interest is that prospective measures of sleep and eating were used in the latter study, whereas the other studies used global patient self-report. Light therapy has been considered a rather benign treatment with few side effects. A systematic report of side effects to light therapy using a light visor showed that approximately 20% of patients reported mild side effects, including headache, eyestrain, and \"feeling wired\". A more controversial topic is the potential for prolonged bright light exposure to produce harmful effects on the retina. The intensities of light used in light therapy regimens are not considered harmful to the human retina based on short term studies, but the retinal effects of long term bright light exposure are not known. Some investigators have called for routine ophthalmologic evaluation prior to starting light therapy because of the small, potential risk of aggravating previously unrecognized retinal conditions (e.g. macular degeneration) [28*]. Others suggest ophthalmologic screening only in patients with a history of pre-existing retinal disease, patients taking highly photosensitizing drugs, and the elderly. Empiric data are still sparse, but a recently reported five-year prospective study of patients on chronic light therapy has not shown any significant clinical or electrophysiologic changes in the eyes . Finally, antidepressant drugs are also being studied in SAD. An open study showed efficacy of bupropion in treating SAD. One case-study suggested that citaloprim, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was as effective as light therapy Fluoxetine was reported to be as effective as light therapy for SAD, and results from at least two double-blind studies of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in SAD will soon be available. What remains a question is whether a combination of medications and light therapy is more effective than either alone. Mental Health Treatment For SAD",
      "My friend's info... *Please note though, I am not a doctor nor a viable replace ment for one. If you are feeling ill or suspect you might have Bipolar, please consult your doctor as he or she is the only one who can truly help you diagnose and/treat this illness or any type of illness! We are here only to help you and give support. We are in no way qualified to give proper medical advice. We can only tell you things that we have learned through our own individual experiences. Everyone is different and any given illness will present itself in different ways in different people.* Bipolar Disorder or also known as Manic Depression, can be generally divided(there are others but these are the most common) in 3 different categories: -Bipolar Type 1 -Bipolar Type 2 -Rapid Cycling Bipolar Type 1 is the most severe form of the illness and will always require a hospital stay at least for the first episode. That is the main difference between Type 1 and Type 2. Type 2 never shows psychotic symptoms, only Type 1, thus Type 2 bipolars are never hospitalized. If they are hospitalized that means that they have Type 1. Although Type 1 is the most severe, it is easier to diagnose than Type 2. Type 2 is very difficult to diagnose as it is sometimes confused for depression if the patient suffers from more downs(depression) than mania. Basically, Bipolar Disorder can be defined as a person experiencing  major mood swings alternating from severe depression and severe mania. The severity of it all will depend on which Bipolar you suffer from. If you have Bipolar Type 1, you will experience at least one full-blown psychotic/manic episode, usually being your first episode. Some will experience more depression than others while some people will experience more mania. Some can experience both stages simultaenously or even experience hypomania which is a mild form of mania, oftentimes experienced by the Type 2 sufferer. Symptoms of mania include the following: (Not all these symptoms need to be present in order for mania to exist) -Lesser need of sleep(4 hours or less) or insommnia but never tired. -Very hyper and even sound of laughter will change and sound eerie. -Feelings of grandiosity or inflated self-esteem(ie. I am the best, I can do anything, etc.) -Sexually inappropriate behaviour or an obession with sex. -Shopping sprees. Spend money recklessly via shopping, gambling, etc. -Irritablitly, easily angered -Can't sit still, be able to get a million things done at once. -Rapid speech -Shoplifting -More common in men than in woman but may become aggressive or violent. -Snappy, sarcastic and down right rude behaviour. -Restlessness -Extremely productive, making lots of plans, and just all over the place. -Others as well. Depression Symptoms: (not all need be present) -Excess need for sleep, always tired and general loss of energy, fatigue -Sucidal thoughts/tendencies. Not wanting to live anymore. -Constant or obsession with suicidal thoughts. -Self-mutiliation or cutting. -Very low self esteem, feelings that life is meaningless. -Extreme sadness, lots of crying -Bulimia can form as it is related to bipolar -Feelings of despair, hopelessness, and feeling desperate to end life. -Stop caring about physical appearance and it will be quite obvious. -Things that used to be enjoyed(hobbies, etc) are no longer pleasurable. -Nothing seems worth it anymore. -Lots of crying , screaming... -Others For Type 1 sufferers, these symptoms above are very severe. During an episode, the above can be suffered but as well as psychotic symptoms below: -Auditory,Visual, and/or Sensory Hallucinations -Extreme Paranoia -Delusions -Loss of touch with reality -Confusion -Others",
      "Major depression is one of the most debilitating illnesses affecting Americans today. It can affect your ability to function, think, and feel. More specifically, it is a mood problem noted by pervasive sadness, disappointment, and hopelessness. The depressed person usually has difficulty finding pleasure in life, has feelings of intense loneliness, and has limited energy to engage in life activities. Most people have periods when they feel discouraged about their circumstances. However, true depression goes deeper by lasting longer and impacting one’s whole existence. People dealing with depression often wish for a better day, but have lost hope that it will come. They do not know how to ‘feel’ better. Those suffering from depression may experience extreme mood fluctuations or a desire to withdraw from interactions with others. Frustrated with the inability to snap out of it, they become more discouraged. In some cases, depression can last for extended periods of time – months or even years. One way to deal with depression is to determine the severity of the experience, understand the influences that prompted its onset, and securing treatment options. Depression Severity Depression can impact a person’s life in many different ways. To a large degree, the manifestation of depression depends on the person’s coping style, personality, and previous level of functioning. Following are some symptoms of depression. Review the areas and determine how you compare with the descriptors. Emotions: - Blunted emotional presentation or frequent crying spells - Difficulty in finding pleasure in life activities Decreased sexual desire Profound feelings of guilt or shame Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness Cold or distant feelings toward family or friends Behavior: Decreased interest in participating in activities previously enjoyed Diminished interest in maintaining one’s hygiene Neglecting responsibilities Reduced coping ability Impaired communication with others (e.g., irritating, sarcastic) Physical Complaints: Lack of energy Compulsive eating or loss of appetite Headaches, backaches, or general muscle aches without a specific cause Gastrointestinal problems (e.g., stomach pain, nausea, change in bowel habits) Insomnia or excessive sleeping If you have several of these symptoms, you may be seriously depressed. Consulting with a professional counselor may be helpful as you determine a way to handle the problem. One step in this process is to understand the various causes of depression. What Causes Depression? Depression can be prompted by a variety of factors. Some episodes of depression are situation-induced. For example, the death of a loved one, the loss of one’s job, or the disappointment of failed efforts to get into graduate school can all initiate an episode of depression. When someone can discern the source of depression, the outlook is more favorable. Specific measures can be incorporated to deal with the pain. However, when no source is clear, the depression may worsen due to lack of treatment. In addition to situational factors, there are other stressors that prompt depression. Chemical imbalances, personality factors, drug and alcohol use, physical illness, and inadequate dietary practices can influence the onset of depression. Given that so many influences can impact one’s mental health, it is important to monitor one’s lifestyle and health practices. Treatment Options All forms of depression are serious if they affect your ability to function. Careful attention to determining the source of inner conflict, strained emotions, and behavioral changes is critical for addressing the development of depression and highlighting treatment options. Key suggestions for offsetting depression include; exercising to work off tension, meditating to clear the mental impurities of the day, changing the routine aspects of your life, developing a support system, and finding a healthy way to release pent up emotions. If these initial steps do not provide relief from the pain, other options are available. Consider speaking with a friend, partner, minister, professional counselor, or psychiatrist to canvass a different perspective. In addition to therapy options, there are medicinal treatments that target depression with noted effectiveness. Self Help",
      "Depression If you suffer from depression, one thing you will be aware of is that it is far more than just feeling down. In fact, depression affects not only how we feel, but how we think about things, our energy levels, our concentration, our sleep, even our interest in sex. So depression has an effect on many aspects of our lives. Depression affects our motivation to do things. We feel apathetic and experience a loss of energy and interest - nothing seems worth doing, everything is so pointless that it's hopeless to even try. We have to drag ourselves around. Each day can be a torment of having to force ourselves to perform even the minor activities. Is all depression the same? No. That answer was short. There are a number of different types. Major depression  has at least five of the following possible symptoms, which have to be present for at least two weeks. • Low mood • Marked loss of pleasure • Significant change in appetite and a loss of at least 5 percent of normal body weight. • Sleep disturbance • Agitation or feelings of being slowed down • Loss of energy or feeling fatigued virtually every day • Feeling worthless, low self-esteem, tendency to feel guilty • Loss of the ability to concentrate • Thoughts of death and suicide If you have such a list as this it is best to seek help from a doctor or a  mental health professional. Depression can have an acute onset, (i.e within days or weeks), or come on gradually (over months or years). It can begin at any time. Sadly, depression is very common. If you suffer from depression you may feel like a failure, if you have a lot of anger and hatred inside, if you are terrified out of your wits, if you think life is not worth living, if you feel trapped and desperate to escape, whatever your feeling, you are not the only one. So many people feel like you do. Of course knowing this does not make your depression less painful, but it does mean that there is nothing bad about you because you are in this state of mind. These feelings are sadly often part of being depressed. Some people who have not been depressed may not understand it or may tell you to pull yourself together, but this does not mean that there is anything bad about you. It just means that they find it difficult to understand. Remember, there are many things that can be done to help people who are depressed. There are some good drugs (antidepressants) available and many effective psychological treatments.",
      "SYMPTOMS A person who suffers from a major depressive disorder (sometimes also referred to as clinical depression or major depression) must either have a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a 2 week period. This mood must represent a change from the person's normal mood. Social, occupational, educational or other important functioning must also be negatively impaired by the change in mood. For instance, a person who has missed work or school because of their depression, or has stopped attending classes altogether or attending usual social engagements. A depressed mood caused by substances (such as drugs, alcohol, medications) is not considered a major depressive disorder, nor is one which is caused by a general medical condition. Major depressive disorder generally cannot be diagnosed if a person has a history of manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes (e.g., a bipolar disorder) or if the depressed mood is better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and is not superimposed on schizophrenia, a delusion or psychotic disorder. Typically the diagnosis of major depression is also not made if the person is grieving over a significant loss in their lives (see note on bereavement below). Clinical depression is characterized by the presence of the majority of these symptoms: depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (In children and adolescents, this may be characterized as an irritable mood.) markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide In addition, for a diagnosis of major depression to be made, the symptoms must not be better accounted for by bereavement, i.e., after the loss of a loved one, the symptoms persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation.",
      "Hypomanic Episode SYMPTOMS A distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting throughout at least 4 days, that is clearly different from the usual nondepressed mood. During the period of mood disturbance, three (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been present to a significant degree: inflated self-esteem or grandiosity decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep) more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli) increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., the person engages in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments) The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the person when not symptomatic. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, or to necessitate hospitalization, and there are no psychotic features. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).",
      "SYMPTOMS A mixed episode is not a disorder, but rather a part of a mental disorder, most commonly bipolar disorder. It consists of meeting the criteria for both a manic episode as well as a major depressive episode nearly every day for at least a full week. Like all mental disorders, the disturbance must be severe enough to cause distress or impairment in social, occupational, education or other important functioning and is not better accounted for by the physiological effects of substance use or abuse (alcohol, drugs, medications) or a general medical condition.",
      "The Facts We all experience a variety of moods such as happiness, sadness, and anger. Unpleasant moods and changes in mood are normal reactions in everyday life, and we can often identify the events that caused our mood to change. However, when we experience changes in mood or extremes of mood that appear \"out of the blue\" and make it hard for us to function, these changes are often the result of a mood disorder. Mood disorders are medical conditions that affect our ability to experience normal mood states, and there are mainly two types: major depressive disorder (also known as unipolar depression), in which all abnormal mood changes involve a lowering of mood, and bipolar disorders (formerly known as manic-depressive disorder), in which at least some of the mood changes involve abnormal elevation of mood. Bipolar disorder typically begins for people during their mid-twenties. It is unusual for bipolar disorder to begin in childhood without strong familial risk factors and it is rare for its onset to occur after the age of sixty (unless associated with another medical condition). Bipolar disorder occurs in about 2% of the adult population. Causes There is no single, proven cause of bipolar disorder, but research suggests that it is the result of abnormalities in the way some nerve cells in the brain function or communicate. Researchers also believe that there is a definite genetic link (family history), in which there is a higher risk for people who have a parent or full-sibling (i.e., a first-relative) with bipolar disorder. Whatever the precise nature of the cause underlying bipolar disorder, it clearly makes people with the disorder more vulnerable to emotional and physical stresses. As a result, upsetting life experiences, alcohol, illicit drug use, lack of sleep, or other stresses can trigger episodes of illness, even though these stresses do not actually cause the disorder. Mood disorders are not the fault of the person suffering from them. They are not the result of a \"weak\" or unstable personality. Mood disorders are treatable medical illnesses for which there are specific medications that help most people. Symptoms and Complications Bipolar disorder is a condition in which the person's mood changes in cycles over weeks to months. The nature of mood changes vary from one person to the next. There are four different kinds of mood states or \"episodes\" in bipolar disorder and these are described in further detail below: mania, hypomania, depression, and mixed episodes involving symptoms of mania and depression. Over the course of the disorder, a person may go through periods of elevated mood, depressed mood, and times when mood is normal. Mania often begins with a pleasurable sense of heightened energy, creativity, and social ease. However, these feelings quickly progress to full-blown euphoria (extremely elevated mood) or severe irritability. During a manic episode, the person will also have at least four of the following symptoms for at least one week: needing little sleep talking so fast that others cannot follow you having racing thoughts having hyperactivity or agitation being so easily distracted that your attention shifts between many topics in just a few minutes having an inflated feeling of power, greatness, or importance doing reckless things without concern about possible consequences (e.g., spending too much money, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making risky business investments) Hypomania is a milder form of mania that has similar but less severe symptoms and has less negative impact on a person's daily activities. During a hypomanic episode, the person may have an elevated mood and be more productive. Because these episodes often feel good, the quest for hypomania may even cause some people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications. However, a person does not usually stay in a hypomanic episode for long and gradually shifts into either mania or depression. Depression: During a depressive episode, the person experiences feelings of sadness or loses interest in the things one normally enjoys. At least four of the following additional symptoms persist for at least two weeks: insomnia (trouble sleeping) or sleeping too much loss of appetite or eating too much decreased interest in pleasurable activities fatigue or loss of interest problems concentrating or making decisions feeling slowed down or feeling too agitated to sit still feeling worthless or guilty or having very low self-esteem recurring thoughts of suicide or death Mixed episodes: The most disabling episodes are those that involve symptoms of both mania and depression together, or alternating frequently during the day. Individuals are excitable or agitated as in mania, but they also feel irritable and depressed. Mixed episodes present the highest risk of suicide. Up to 15% of all people with bipolar disorder may commit suicide. In severe cases of bipolar disorder, the person may also experience psychotic symptoms which are hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there) or delusions (firmly believing things that are not true). Patterns of bipolar disorder People with bipolar disorder vary in the types and frequency of episodes that they experience. Some people may have equal numbers of manic and depressive episodes, while others may have mostly one type or the other. On average, a person has four episodes during the first 10 years of having bipolar disorder. While several years can pass between the first few episodes, without treatment most people eventually have more frequent episodes. Episodes can last for days, weeks, months, or sometimes even years. Classifications According to the episode patterns, bipolar disorder can be classified as: Bipolar type 1 - a person has one or more manic episodes, usually accompanied by major depressive episodes. Bipolar type 2 - a person has only hypomanic and depressive episodes, not full mania or mixed episodes. Hypomania often seems normal to the person, and they seek treatment only for depression. Rapid cycling bipolar disorder - a person has at least four episodes per year in any combination of mania, hypomania, mixed, or depression. Making the Diagnosis A doctor will diagnose bipolar disorder based on a pattern of symptoms. Diagnosis usually involves a thorough medical history, questions about family history, a physical exam, and a psychiatric evaluation that assesses the history of depression and mania episodes. Early and proper diagnosis is an important step towards preventing other complications such as suicide; alcohol or substance abuse; marital or work problems; and more frequent cycling episodes. Treatment and Prevention People with bipolar disorder will receive treatment to manage their current episodes as well as treatment on a long-term basis to prevent future episodes. Components of treatment include medications, education, and psychotherapy. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is usually reserved for people who do not respond to treatment with medications for bipolar disorder. Medications: Treatment for bipolar disorder must be customized to fit the individual because the patterns and severity of this disorder vary from one person to the next. Long-term medications are commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. Medications used to manage bipolar disorder are as follows: Mood stabilizers: Most people with bipolar disorder are treated with medications called mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium*, divalproex or valproic acid, carbamazepine). These medications provide relief from current episodes, prevent them from recurring, and do not worsen depression or mania, or lead to increased cycling. Sometimes other medications normally used to treat people who have epilepsy are used to treat symptoms of bipolar disorder (e.g., gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate). Combination therapy with two mood stabilizers is sometimes recommended for people who do not respond to or develop resistance to the use of one medication. These medications need to be closely monitored by the doctor. Antidepressants: These medications treat the symptoms of depression, and they work by altering the levels of certain chemicals in the brain in a way that elevates a person's mood. For people with bipolar disorder, antidepressants must be used together with a mood stabilizer medication to prevent cycling into a manic episode. Many types of antidepressants are available, working in different ways, and with different side effect profiles. Other medications may be prescribed by the doctor for other problems associated with bipolar disorder such as medications for sleeping, anxiety, restlessness, or thought disturbances. It is important for people with bipolar disorder to keep taking these medications in order for the drugs to work properly in managing this condition. Do not stop taking these medications or adjust the dose on your own, without speaking to your doctor or pharmacist first. Symptoms that recur after medications have been stopped are sometimes much harder to treat. Talk to your doctor and pharmacist if you have any questions about the medications you are taking and ask about possible side effects. Education and counselling: Learning more about bipolar disorder and seeking counselling can help people and their families learn how to best manage the condition and prevent other complications from occurring. Psychotherapy: Psychoeducation (or psychotherapy) is usually combined with medication to help people with bipolar disorder and their families understand and deal with the medical condition. Specific psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural, interpersonal, and problem-solving therapy can be as effective as antidepressants in treating the depressive episodes in bipolar disorder). Other things that a person with bipolar disorder can do to help reduce symptoms include: learn to recognize early warning signs of a new mood episode try to get enough sleep, and go to bed at a regular hour each night exercise regularly avoid alcoholic beverages and street drugs reduce stress at work and in everyday life eat a well-balanced diet keep a diary to track your daily feelings, activities, sleep patterns, life events, and side effects of medications. This will help you and your doctor determine which treatment works best for you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *All medications have both common (generic) and brand names. The brand name is what a specific manufacturer calls the product (e.g., Tylenol®). The common name is the medical name for the medication (e.g., acetaminophen). A medication may have many brand names, but only one common name. This article lists medications by their common names. For more information on brand names, speak with your doctor or pharmacist.",
      "Blues · Chronic Depression The Facts Depression is a medical condition characterized by long-lasting feelings of intense sadness and hopelessness coupled with additional mental and physical changes. The condition often affects a person's personal, social, and/or professional life. About one in five women and one in ten men will suffer from depression at some point in life. Depression in children and adolescents occurs less commonly than in adults. Almost 1.5 million Canadians have serious depression at any given time, but less than one third of these people seek medical help. Types of Depression There are several different types of depression, and the diagnosis is mostly determined by the nature and intensity of the mental and physical symptoms, the duration of the symptoms, and the specific cause of the symptoms, if that is known. Clinical depression (or major depressive disorder, MDD) is the most serious type of depression, in terms of the number and severity of symptoms, but there are significant individual differences in the symptoms and severity. People affected with major depression may not have suicidal tendencies, and may never have received medical treatment. The person's interest and pleasure in many activities, energy levels, and eating and sleeping patterns are usually altered. Dysthymia (or minor depression) refers to a low-to-moderate level of depression that persists for at least two years, and often longer. While the occurrence of symptoms is not as frequent as in major depression, dysthymia can result in as much disability as major depression. It is often not recognized that dysthymia is a medical condition that responds equally effectively to the same treatments as major depression. Some people with dysthmia develop a major depression at some time during the course of their depression. Bipolar depression (or manic depression) includes both high and low mood swings, and a variety of other significant symptoms not present in other types of depression. Other types of depression include seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and post-partum depression. SAD is a sub-type of depression that regularly occurs at the same time of year (most often in the fall or winter months in North America). Post-partum depression begins a few weeks after giving birth and is a sub-type of depression. Post-partum depression is different from the temporary state known as the \"baby blues\" that often happens 24 to 72 hours after a woman gives birth. This temporary state is caused by the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy and after giving birth and typically resolves in less than a week. In some cases, depression is associated with other chronic medical conditions, which negatively impact the person's quality of life and well-being. Causes Depression is caused by imbalances of the chemicals that help to send messages in the brain. These chemicals in our brain also help to regulate our emotions, behaviour, and thinking. Depression is not the result of personal weakness or an inability to cope. Depression has a strong genetic component (i.e., family history). While the tendency to be depressed is genetically inherited, the onset of depression can be provoked by many factors. Triggers of depression include: difficult or traumatic life changes (such as losing a loved one) medical conditions such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, chronic pain, and some types of cancer use of certain medications, including corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, narcotics, benzodiazepines, and street drugs such as amphetamines progesterone (found in some female hormonal pills) alcohol, which has short-term and possibly long-term depressive effects Symptoms and Complications Although we all feel sad sometimes, clinical (major) depression is diagnosed when a person experiences depressed mood (sadness) and/or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities for at least two weeks, plus five of the following symptoms: changes in appetite or weight slowed reactions lack of motivation or energy insomnia (trouble sleeping) or chronic oversleeping noticeable changes in activity level (agitated or slowed down) feelings of worthlessness or guilt difficulty concentrating or making decisions recurring thoughts of death or suicide Clinical depression may vary in its severity, and in its extreme forms (i.e., thoughts of suicide) can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Symptoms of other forms of depression, although generally milder, may still negatively affect a person's daily activities and quality of life. Making the Diagnosis If you meet the criteria in the section \"Symptoms and Complications,\" you may be suffering from depression. Talk things through with your family and friends, and with your doctor. Physicians are trained to help you, and to take depression and its treatment seriously. Together with your doctor, you can begin to identify and manage the nature of the problem, and then develop a treatment plan. This may include a referral to a psychiatrist or psychotherapist. Treatment and Prevention Most types of depression respond to either an antidepressant medication or psychotherapy. Sometimes people with depression are unaware that medications can help them, or they are at first hesitant to take antidepressant medications to manage their condition. However there are many different medications available today to help treat depression. You and your doctor can work together to decide what medication is best for you. Medications used to treat depression begin to work after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment, although improvements in some symptoms may be seen within the first few weeks. In some situations, more than one medication will need to be tried until the most appropriate one is found for an individual. All medications, including antidepressants, can have side effects. Your doctor and pharmacist should explain common side effects to you and help you to manage them should they occur. Herbals: Studies have shown that St. John's Wort is not effective for people with clinical (major) depression. Although people with mild symptoms may receive some benefit from it, you should talk to your doctor and pharmacist before taking any herbals or over-the-counter medications. Keep in mind that some herbal medications may interact with prescription or over-the-counter medications. Psychotherapy can be an important part of managing depression. Psychiatrists, psychologists, and some family doctors are trained to help people recognize and overcome the kind of thinking that causes depression. Support groups, friends, and family can also help. Other treatments: In more severe cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used but is generally reserved for those who do not respond to medications. Light therapy (or \"phototherapy,\" which involves controlled exposure to artificial sunlight) can help some people overcome symptoms associated with seasonal affective disorder. Physical activity and sports can improve depression by helping to relieve anxiety, increase appetite, aid sleep, and improve mood and self-esteem. Exercise also increases the body's production of endorphins, a natural mood-elevating hormone. An active lifestyle, supportive family and friends, and a positive outlook can go a long way in coping with depression."

      "So before I get into all of this, I'll get some things out of the way. I started this PsychForums and sold it because there were some threats made against me by some of the members and it was getting too stressful. I've stayed away for a long time but I've decided that I deserve support too so screw those that threatened me. I no longer own this website. I sold it in 2015. I have NOTHING to do with running this site, I'm not even a Moderator and I don't want to be. The company I sold it to is able to distance themself against those threats and keep their staff safe, which makes me incredibly happy. So, now that I'm done. I've been dealing with Depression all my life, mostly driven by my PTSD, which was undiagnosed until 1998. I was SA in Kindergarten by a volunteer at the school and each year during the back to school season and again during the Holidays I deal with Anniversaries of significant abuse. Medication isn't effective. Therapy isn't as effective as it used to be because I've processed as much of the trauma as I can and the Depression is still there. I'm not willing to undergo ECT because I've had a Stroke and I have Seizures. I also have Memory Loss as a result of the Stroke (and the Seizures) and I don't want to add to that, which the ECT would do. My Insurance won't pay for TMS or other treatments which might offer some relief. I'm reaching a point of giving up. Every day is a struggle to wake up at this point. I'm only holding on because of my wife.",
      "It was actually around 22009 or 2010 that I sold the site, my wife reminded me that it was a few years before we got Married. My memory isn't what it used to be after my Stroke and Heart Attack. I know that Mental Health Matters was sold in 2018 and they weren't able to deal with keeping the site updated and wound up turning it into a page that forwarded to their therapy practice after about 18 months.",
      "Welcome back. Everyone's safety is important here & we've closed a couple of sub-forums that were too difficult to manage (AsPD & Para). We are always open to suggestions on how to make PF work better for you. As I read your topic title, I immediately thought of electro-shock therapy. After reading your opening post, I see that ECT is probably not a good option. I suffered a stroke myself about 4 years ago. Some things have come back, some haven't. I'm alive & grateful for what I do have. It was a very sudden & unexpected retirement. I take Zoloft to stop my mind from ruminating & quiet the ear-worm music (I can't stand that stupid song anyways). Physically, I'm limited, but I still do what I can. I try to stay positive by applying the 12-steps again in my life to my current situation. I've changed (according to other people) for the better. I'm kinder. I'm not so uptight about money (but it does come to the surface once in a while). I like to tinker on a workbench & do crosswords to relax. I have had my driving privileges restored, but I don't drive much. I still have oculomotor & orientation issues. My care team works with me & I work with them. I make sure that they all know about what the other team-members have planned for me in the way of treatments. Things just work smoother when everybody's on the same page. Speak with your team. Consider your options. If the depression is drug-resistant & ECT is off the table because of other complicating factors, then TMS might become 'medically-necessary'. Have your team make the case to insurers in every way possible. https://karmadocs.com/the-cost-of-tms-w ... ete-guide/ The very best of luck & blessings to you.",
      "My only suggestion is to never open those two forums again. When I started this, I tried to give everyone a voice. By the time I realized that was a mistake, I was getting a variety of threats both online and in the mail. Glad to hear you're recovering, and things are continuing to improve. I'm continuing to improve as well, but have learned to accept that some things will never come back all the way. I'm lucky in that all my care team is through one organization with the exception of my Opthalmologist, so they all have access to my care notes and I am able to coordinate through my Primary Care Doc. I'm starting to drive again, but only on the good days. My seizures are mostly controlled and are part of my Hemiplegic Migraines, so I don't drive at all on days when I have Migraines. I'm trying to get back to where I can either go back to school to finish my Bachelor's or go back to work. I'm just tired of sitting at home. Anyway, back to the point... TMS was likely Medically Necessary at the time I first applied, but the joy of Medicaid is that they are so damn tight that I doubt they will ever honor something that costs them money when just packing me with more pills that don't work is cheaper. I don't want to go through 4 rounds of pills that don't work just to prove them wrong. So here we are, and here we'll stay."

      "Hello everyone, I'm writing here because I've been struggling to read for a while now. Difficulty concentrating on the stories I read, on the sentences but most of all, it seems that I don't actually feel that much when I read the written words, which makes me sad. I've had depressive episodes since 16-17 years old (now 31) and nowadays I can have periods of time when I'm really anxious and/or depressed (the anxiety being generally more present than the depression). I'm wondering if the fact that I don't feel anything when reading is related to the depression/anxiety or is it just me losing interest in that activity ? Any kind of input is welcome Looking forward to reading your answers.",

      "I'm struggling with depression at the moment. Life has been slamming me harder than usual. I don't know where to begin to explain everything so I won't. My life is complex and complicated with a lot of past traumas and abuse. My problem is that nothing seems to help and I have tried a LOT of things. I'm educated, self-aware, and emotionally intelligent, I read self-help books and I practice things. I've done a lot of therapy. Why am I so depressed? Why do I hate my life? Why, after all that time and effort and work in therapy, do I still hate myself and nothing has changed? Why is everything so hard lately? It feels like I can't find anything that actually makes a difference. I recognize I'm stuck in my ways, but I really have put in an effort to change and do better, and it's led nowhere. I feel like a complete failure. I've been having breakdowns every day since last week. I'm...exhausted. Deeply exhausted from managing and coping for so long.

      "I remember that a couple years ago a psychiatrist told me they would prescribe anti-depressant once I had been abstaining from weed for 3 months, which is what ended up happening. Does this seem usual to you? I quit using weed a week ago. Now I want to try anti-depressants again and I don't really want to wait three months while severely depressed again. It sucked the first time, especially the disillusionment since the stupid ######6 pills ended up doing nothing, as usual. Thanks for reading.",
      "I don't know how long THC remains in the system, but from what I see, mixing it definitely wouldn't be a good idea.  So... either the doctor is thinking about half-life of the weed, or- and I'm leaning in this direction- three months without is something significant- proof that you are serious about not mixing.  Or perhaps three months is needed to get over the cravings for the stuff.  Won't hurt to ask him his reasoning, but from what I see, most doctors are going to be pretty firm on you staying weed-free, it seems to be fairly complicated and counterproductive to try to regulate via antidepressants while imbibing in marijuana.  I am on Lexapro generic, and I used to be a moderate-slightly heavy drinker, and I got an earful about that, when I was placed on an SSRI.  I took it to heart, and only drink lightly and on occasion.  But it mustn't become a regular habit.  From what I can see, weed would have a similar effect that alcohol does when it comes to antidepressants- both intensify side effects (drowsiness, decreased reaction, etc) while at the same time, in the larger picture, counteracting the therapeutic effects of the antidepressant.  Like booze, it appears weed can be both a depressant, and a stimulant.  I was read the riot act about drinking, I don't expect they'll be easy on you about weed."

      "I follow this fellow mostly for his Covid information, but in this video he talks about depression. The TL;DR is that depression doesn't seem to be as related to serotonin as previously thought.  New information intimates that there is no difference in serotonin levels in people with or without depression.  SSRIs do work for depression, but the medical community is realising they don't know why they work. https://youtu.be/TZhgvr2rbwE",

I refuse to take SSRI's ever again. Personally I think they damaged me and I have symptoms of neurological disease. My hands and feet go numb frequently and in the freezing cold my arms and legs go totally limp. My mind also feels really slow at random times. Some days better than others. I blame SSRI's for causing me these symptoms. I feel like I have been seriously damaged by them. Not to discourage somebody from taking them. I'm actually scheduled to go to a nurse at the place I've been getting counseling, for getting new psych meds soon. But I'll probably get the rx and not take it. I might take them if they're mood stabilizers like Abilify. But not the SSRI's. Those things have seriously damaged me, physically. I just know it. I will probably seek a diagnosis for MS or Parkinsons and I know that SSRI's caused it.",

How ever I have found Abilify to make me extra sleepy at times during the day. I suspect I have MS or some unknown Prozac/psych med induced neurological condition.... I'd just be careful about taking SSRI's for years... Oh and I was suicidal too.. Because of  how long i took Prozac. It changed my personality. But I am finding Abilify to be helpful. Is Escitalopram , Lexapro or Cymbalta. I never took those for long, bad side effects. Prozac has a weird anxiety inducing effect tho. I find the non typical AP's to be most helpeful in my case.",
      "dusty333 wrote: Is Escitalopram , Lexapro or Cymbalta. I Generic for Lexapro.  Other than some minor sexual side effects, I tolerate it well on 10mg/day.  It takes enough of an edge off my anxiety that I'm better able to function.  Maybe even a little with my OCD, though that's not a for-sure.  My main resentment is that while taking it I have to be more careful of alcohol consumption, and I find potential interactions with OTC medications such as cold meds and ibuprofen to be rather onerous.  Also that it forces me into biannual blood tests. I also take a dose of Trazodone at bedtime, off-label for insomnia, though I have hopes that also being an antidepressant, it makes me a little less like Eeyore. I went on both these, because I presented at the doctor with heart palpitations.  I do find that they help with that.  Again, just enough to keep the worse of my anxiety at arm's length.  And I can't imagine either of these being long term worse than the decades I took Benadryl every night as a sleep aid- there are indications that might have increased my risk for dementia.  Time will tell, though if it does I suppose I won't be terribly aware of it after it sets in will I?  Meh.  Is what it is.",
      "I forgot I was replying to the admin. lol. I used to take Lexapro. I found going to church and praying to be helpful for my depression and nighttime insomnia. After I went to church alot I have been sleeping less and been waking up early in the morning. And I feel less depressed. But I still AM depressed and have had intense anxiety and panic, I started feeling better before I started Abilfy but it has helped with my appetite and completely cut my compulsions, and reduced my anxiety. But I think that God also healed me from that. I dont want to get on any SSRIs. Im still worried that even taking abilify will damage me more but it has a good effect on my mental health and appetite , and the compulsions i had were distressing. so taking it might have an overall better effect on my health than not taking it except that if i quit it, all of that might get worse? And iw as having crippling anxiety constantly. I dont know if i was like that cause I'm addicted to psych meds since Ive took them almost all my life. I think my brain was used to taking them. That's the problem I have with them. And then who knows what conditions they may cause in the long run. Like neurological diseases, heart disease, etc. Especially if your body is addicted and you quit and start again and took it for decades. I'm worried about the long term effects.",
      "I agree about long term effects, especially if someone can expect to live many more years.  Being old has its advantages- I'm not worried about 30 years from now, I expect to be worm food So I can take a slightly more relaxed attitude. But yes there's some nasty things out there, especially if anything's an anti-psychotic, I feel.  At least, I knew someone one some older generation stuff for moderately severe schizophrenia, and some of that stuff just melt your brain- or at least, that's what the mass of long-term effects translated in my mind as: Melt Your Brain. So I totally get that.  Seems to me it's a compromise- the least amount of meds needed to 'take the edge off' and allow a person to function and to not be too miserable.  I don't want to just take a pill for this and a pill for that; but if I can take a pill or two to keep me from flying into pieces, then give it to me I'm ready.  I take Lexapro generic, and Trazodone for insomnia- off label and it's an older medicine but it's originally an antidepressant as is the Lexapro, and while the latter's for my anxiety, maybe I feel a little less depressed on it.  I'd like to think so, anyway.  I did quit the Lexapro for a while- cold turkey, in fact.  But when I started feeling stressful, I resumed it gladly."

      "Hi everyone. I've been struggling with depressing for as long as I can remember. I have Clinical Depression, GAD, autism & Complex ptsd. I feel so hopeless. I'm struggling to get up out of bed each day. I just stare at the ceiling or scroll on my phone. My house is a mess. My life is a mess. I don't have the energy to cook most days so I eat like crap & even just showering is a huge effort. I experienced a lot growing up & its led to feelings of shame, guild, self loathing & just like feeling like I domt deserve anything good or dont deserve to take care of myself. Health problems have made me gain a lot of weight & I was never attractive before but I know I'm definitely not now. And I'm so lonely. I don't have any confidence & my anxiety is so bad that I can't join clubs or meet new people. My insecurities are just getting the better of me & frankly ruining everything. People tell me I should be happy on my own, but growing up feeling unloved & being abused, I jusy crave that love and affection & I want to give that to someone else I think it's human nature to seek companionship but I know I wouldn't be a good partner right now. I'm always sad & I feel like it's not fair for my partner to have to support me through how bad my mental health gets. I feel so unloved. I know that my jnsecurites cause problems in my relationships. I know my anxiety is hard to deal with & all of this just makes me feel lower than I already do. I'm a hopeless romantic who always dreamed about the one & I cope by living in fantasyland most if the time I guess.  By that I mean I constantly imagine scenarios it a future partner and what it'll be like. I know I need to put myself first. I know I need to eat healthier, eat regularly, exercise more, lose the weight. I'm afraid it's never gonna happen for me. That I'm too complex, too needy, too much, too ugly. That I'll spend tje rest of my life feeling unwanted & alone. I need to pull myself out of this place and I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to get tje motivation to do the things I need to. I spend all day sometimes getting ready & sitting on the couch just willing myself to go outside. I'm working in my mental health, I've been attending therapy for 13 years now. It's only just started to help last year and then therapy ended because they discharged me. Therapy was the only thing that kept me going having an outelt, a safe place to talk things through. But that's gone now. I'm at the mercy of the health care system who decides if I get treatment or not. So not much I can do there. I used to be a lot more active. But I became disabled & I have chronic pain now which makes things difficult. I look in the mirror & I hate my body. I hate how i look. It isnt me. But I have an untreated Eating disorder so when I exercise I become obsessed with it & with calories & tracking my food. I'm feeling so low & unmotivated. I know I'm the problem. I just need to try harder. But I'm trying so hard just to keep it all together & feed myself & manage my pain & disabilities, there's not much else left honestly. I just fear I'll end up sad & alone"

      "I feel pretty depressed. I'm stuck in a rut and not going anywhere. I feel hopeless. I just can't go on like this. This is the worst!",
      "Are you seeing anyone, or taking anything for it?",
      "I have a therapist.  I tried antidepressants but they didn’t work for me.",
      "I take it you tried several, then?",
      "Yes, I have.",
      "I'm sorry to hear nothing's quite taken.  I know sometimes it can be really difficult, if it's severe enough.  We used to have a member here I was fairly close with, who struggled with severe depression and all the meds do was just maintain her existence, pretty much. I sympathise.  I think my entire life is a rut- I know how it feels.",
      "It's good to know I'm not alone.",
      "I feel the same tbh. When I was a teenager, I didn't really have alot of reason to be depressed, but after enduring sexual trauma in my adulthood, I found a reason I guess. I used to not have bad memories. MY counselor diagnosed me with PTSD also. The memories I have of bad sexual encounters and stuff related to that (old lechers harassing me) had added a whole new basement level to my depression. I guess it's not as bad as some of the posts I've read on here about people who endured sexual abuse by parents, but I am still dealing with the same kind of abuse in adulthood by other men (not family but) it has really crippled me. I also have Aspergers and feel like, family and others treat me like it's kind of my lot in life to be a single woman, when all I ever wanted was to be married and have a child like any other woman. I get so depressed by how others have treated me really. Alot of people have kicked me while Im down. And Im grieving over an ex of sorts who had commited suicide, they told me he went off his bipolar meds. And I think he did it cause I had rejected him... Because he had rejected me first after I slept with him... I was 29 and he was 55... And now Im thinking even he wasnt genuine about wanting a commitment.... I've hurt my self a lot by sleeping around and yet I never had a boyfriend. And I dont have any real friends, I have a few who live too far to meet up with. But I have nobody to hang out with here. If I hadnt gotten that older man fired and he had to move away and then khs, at least Id have had him to hang out with here. But he probably would have hurt me any ways. I just feel like IVe gotten a bad deal... Especially since I was not raised in a bad environment where these kind of bad men should be hurting me. Sorry if I brought my bad \"relationships\" into this reply... But that's became a major reason why I am so depressed. Now i am sleeping all day, and staying up all night... Every single daylight hour now is gone... And I know that is damaging me...  I also have damage from having taken Prozac for about 17 years total. My body is just jarred from SSRI use and my brain has became suicidal because of it. I have just this intense feeling in my brain, at most times , and I want that painful feeling to go away. You know what I mean? It's like this intense, kind of manic feeling, where I want to get up and just go jump off a bridge or do something crazy (not that Im saying im planning that) but, well, I do aggressive inline skating, and there is a very high death or injury risk (like breaking your back or cracking your head open) and I go to skateparks, and do big airs and tricks where there is a risk for that. It's kind of cathartic for me when I'm feeling \"intense\"... You know what I mean about that \"intense\" feeling? Sorry if that was tmi... Just trying to explain why Im so depressed.... If i had normal relationships/friendships, if people had treated me normally, instead of evil men using me and hurting me, and people have also bullied/slandered me as well  like 3 different times. I am just kind of crippled by all my bad memories. even if theyre not as bad as some of the abuse forum posts Ive read... But theyre my own memories, and theres things Ive done that are hard to live with. It just all added up. Another thing is that, my \"ex\" (of 2 weeks) who killed himself, visits me sometimes in my dreams and in spirit when Im awake. I've developed psychic senses I guess I could say, in my mental illness. Not that Im hallucinating. I really believe that he visits me. Because he commited suicide, he also knew when he was living that I told him I was going to commit suicide. Well he was the one who ended up doing it. I thought he was stronger than that. But I think he makes it a point to watch over me a lot, and every day my senses of knowing HES HERE with me increase. When he visits me, I feel peaceful and happier, and my suicidal \"intense pain\" goes away. He really helps me with that. lol. I know I must sound crazy. Like Im hallucinating...But thats actually been helping me...."

      "The TL;DR is that I apparently don't have a sense-of-reality edge over the Pollyannas out there, and yes, it rather irritates me.  I've been a ######6 Eeyore for nothing? https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/art ... -Robust-to So much for my self-consolation that at least I have a better grasp on reality over those folks that don't get depression and anxiety.  Apparently I'll have to try harder with the medicine I dole out in the OCD forum and make a conscious decision to not give a $#%^.  Meh. On a less depressive note, what the study does is undermine a long-standing theory (based on a study done decades ago) that suggested folks like me were wiser in the aspect of being more 'realistic' about the situation of the world surrounding us.  I expect the worst to happen and of course when it does I'm not disappointed because everything sucks.  Apparently, my grasp of Reality turns out to not be any better than those for whom the glass is always half-full."

I suspect I may have treatment-resistant depression. I have had a very difficult, challenging life. Survived multiple traumas, to the point where I don't even know myself anymore. I have been trying to figure out how on earth I can be a happier person. But maybe the truth is, I can't be. I'm not designed to be. It's not that I don't have gratitude, I do. I take the time, every moment I find something I appreciate, to express gratitude or appreciation for it. However, this doesn't make me a happier person. It just means I'm grateful but still depressed. I've taken time to notice and write down the things that make me happy, but they don't consistently make me happy. I'm 36 and don't have a career. I'm not married and have no kids. I don't really have anything (doesn't help I lost almost everything last year, but that's a trauma story). I feel very aimless in my life. I read books, and articles and do all sorts of research to find my purpose, and figure out how to add meaning to my life. I feel constantly thwarted, stuck, and like I'm never going anywhere. My life is what it is, but what it makes me unhappy. So I'm stuck in this endless loop of going nowhere and having severe life dissatisfaction. I have a therapist, I work on myself ALL the time but it feels like nothing helps or makes a difference. I'm just...stuck in this miserable existence of endless suffering and I don't know what to do with myself or my life because I feel like I've been doing things without results. What do you do when you're this...hopeless? I work so hard and go nowhere. I'm perpetually confused about myself. I don't know who I am, where I'm going, what I should be doing. Where to begin? OR if this just IS what my life is and I need to accept it but that makes me more depressed. I feel like I have no control over my life.",
      "I didn't get married until 46 years old, no kids, but I enjoy everyone else's. It's OK to be an uncle. It's OK to be different. We shouldn't measure success and failure like we do. Who's standards are we going by anyway? I did work, eat, sleep as the decades slipped by. I drank heavily in my free time instead of being with people.  Life wasn't life for many years. It was existence. I was empty. I did mental health therapy. I was treated for depression & panic attacks. I was on mild meds. I attended 12 step programs. I couldn't get better alone & I was an isolator. All of a sudden I'm old. I didn't really expect to still be here. My friendship matters to friends & family. Later in life I finally have my peace. I was missing an important 'frame of reference' in my self-imposed isolation. I was hiding. I was ashamed. Of what? I did not know. Being around other people didn't make me feel so unique with 'my' problems. Or the problems I thought I had. Many people are worse off than you or me, but we can't see that or feel their pain when we are stuck in our head. Many of us can't or don't make it through. Be one of the ones who makes it through. Best of luck to you.",

I can say that because I had depression for many, many years and I couldn't find a fix. Speak honestly with your doctor.  This med doesn't work, this one doesn't either, things like that. There are many new medications out there.  I have Bipolar I, and it took 8 years to be diagnosed.  8 long years in which the depression never went away.  It is easy to lose hope, I do know this from personal experience.  I literally had to have a manic episode for me to be diagnosed bipolar and the. treatment began from there based on that diagnosis.  And eventually I got to where I am at.  I have the right medications and I am stable with no depression any longer.  This is my personal story only. Do your best. I worked as a cafeteria helper, basically, a cafeteria lady for just over a year and eventually I moved up to a different job with a bit better pay and more hours.  I understand about not having a career.  I go to school part time and right now I have a D.  Very disheartening.  I have a whole another half of a semester to raise that grade.  I will work much harder.  I may never get my degree are the things that run through my mind, and that is ok.  I just want to live my life the best I am able to and be happy.  Happiness doesn't mean you have to be working in a position that you have to be way up there like an accountant.  (that is my goal to be become an accountant),  I just want to be happy.  I will still try very hard to get my degree, but it won't take away from my happiness if I don't reach that goal in this lifetime.  Be easy on yourself.  I even thought about being a custodian.  No shame in that.  Big cyber hug to you!"

      "I have recently broken up with my wife after a 6 year marriage, we have 1 child who is almost 2. My wife suffers from ADHD and I have Bi-Polar I disorder. We are both on medication, my wife decided to stop taking her medication last year things slowly fell apart. I left the house to save health and did not want my son to see us argue so we decided to co-parent. I have since moved back to my parents, my wife became pregnant to another man we both knew who I trusted as a friend for 20 years. It was 2 months after I left our house and has now had the baby after an 8 month pregnancy. We have not divorced or completed settlement on our house, we are still co-parenting though I am now having to pick up my son from her new partners house. She moved on so quickly that I am completely confused, angry, upset. I am still grieving the loss of what could have been a family with a nice home. Since the stress of leaving I have periods of Greif and general depression but I have also had worrying Bi-Polar symptoms. Myself as a coping mechanism found love online (of what I thought at the time) someone from overseas.. I sent some money after days and months of talking. I even went to the lengths of buying an airline ticket and meanwhile at the same time managing to keep \"normal\" behavior away from what I thought was a great way of helping someone and possibly bringing them to my country now I realize I was highly manic (though not psychotic) Over time I slowly realized the online love was nothing but me sending small amounts of money to a sociopath.. My mind wanted to not believe this though but also I felt cheated AGAIN after what had happened with my marriage, I also felt like all the time invested in those fake emotions online I could have thought about plans with my son in my spare time. I started doing more healthy things like seeing my old friends playing golf going for walks and enjoying and cherishing the times I am with my son. I finally deleted the contact of my online \"girlfriend\" 3 weeks ago and vowed to not contact again after she threatened to tell my wife on Facebook everything I had said to her....I also got a flight credit.. The last 3 weeks though I have fallen into a deep depression much more morbid than usual. That is why I decided to find this forum and ask for some help to see if anyone else suffers my symptoms in a Depressive relapse?? In the past I have suffered this symptom which can be highly stressful, it has happened after every stressor in my life and sometimes before a psychosis. I have constant negative intrusive thoughts of almost everything I look at sometimes linking colors to objects then fearing certain colors even though I know it is nonsense. My thoughts just make up fears for no reason instead of enjoying tasks and just getting through the day and thinking of ideas and having fun as I was, I just feel frozen withdrawn and can't daydream good thoughts and ideas anymore. A few days ago I had my first panic attack in 17 years all this came out of the stress I think from the past year and too much thinking but at the same time I don't know if it's Depression, OCD or even PTSD?? Please help",
      "Hello and welcome to the forums! Goes without saying I'm just a moderator, not a clinician- however as a mod I felt that your bipolar diagnosis was a major factor in this, and as such I've moved this to the bipolar forum- but have left a shadow link in the clinical depression forum so that it can be followed to this forum, as it seems this straddles categories. Depending on how the thread progresses if it feels it belongs somewhere else, the Bipolar mod might elect to place it somewhere else.  You definitely have a lot going on and my sympathies.  I'm glad you cut off the online love interest, I know people for whom that's seemed to work but I'm also pretty sure the opportunities for abuse are legion. Since you're on medication, have you discussed any of this with your doctor to see if anything could be done to adjust meds or dosages?  At least for the short term, to help you through this stressful time in your life.  I don't have bipolar (that I know of) but from folks I know with the condition, well, the people I know, I know they can fall into some pretty deep troughs, but I also have faith that they'll pull out of them.  A person has to have faith even when it feels pointless- if I didn't at least act as if my own situations could get better, well, I'd already be lying in a ditch somewhere, I guess. I didn't notice a mention of being diagnosed with anything but bipolar, but given that you've been taking some hits from intrusive thoughts, it might help to start a thread in OCD centered just on that aspect of it.  Not to say it's OCD but intrusive thoughts are an OCD superpower, so that's a good forum to address them, unless Otter (the mod in this forum) thinks they're better talked about in Bipolar.  You've mentioned psychosis, but your wording with the thoughts shows you grasp that the intrusive thoughts are thoughts, and not a total disconnect with reality.  Thus my suggestion of talking about the intrusive thoughts in OCD, while you also have this thread in the mood forums for the depressive symptoms.  Not that you have to do that, it's just a suggestion that I give sometimes when someone has a whole lot of things going on that might do better broken up into more manageable bites.  Otter will be the expert on that idea, though. Welcome again to the forums.",
      "Yours is a very complex and painful situation and I am sorry you are going through it. But I do want to say that I felt hopeful reading your post because you seem to be aware of your illness and the role it plays, as well as needing to do something to try and stay healthy. But now it seems like you are overwhelmed and the anxiety and depression are peaking. May I ask, having Bipolar 1 and you mentioned psychosis - are you prone to psychosis? In other words, does it take a lot of stress or being off-meds to trigger it? I have BP 2 but a close friend has BP 1. It takes a good deal of depression to trigger their psychosis. And the signs are usually such that she can reach out for help. Does your psychiatrist work as a therapist as well? If not, maybe it's time to reach out to one. You need someone to help organize your thoughts and someone you can reach out to at a moment's notice. You are in a critical time right now and I am concerned for you. Do your parents understand your illness? Can you talk to them? That's really what you need here. You need to surround yourself with people who understand you or at least treat you with kindness - and avoid the stresses of people who bring you grief. As Snaga said, talking to your Psych and moderating your meds might help. As for love online, I am sorry you had to learn the hard way that there are scammers everywhere. Rule one: never send money. Please let us know how you are doing. Mod comment. If the OP doesn't mind, this is the right place, if there is a shadow link in depression (meaning, the title can be seen there but it links to this forum).",
      "Thankyou for replying to my post I have a diary of days which I feel at my worst. I give each day a score out of 10 on anxiety levels I also mention what I managed to accomplish that day and the amount of sleep I had the night before. As I work from home and like to stay up and work this is a hard thing to change but I will. Now that I am single and I am in a granny flat by myself at my parents it is not a good place to be alone with depression/anxiety after a breakup though I have told my parents my depressive relapse though not my symptoms, they are quiet overprotective and I am now 37 and an only child so I like to try and keep a distance, but it is a hard time. I think also I have memories of when my father \"also with bi-polar\" was going through psychosis here many times when I was very young then myself having 2 episodes in the past here and worrying about \"losing it\" again. During the past few days I have definitely noticed that a better nights sleep with a walk helps me manage easier, hopefully this will be a passing phase as I have had this happen a few times, once it was a medication error after a bout of stress. I will be seeing my doctor Wednesday and I will ask for a medication review I will also give an update on how I am travelling, fingers crossed things will get better",
      "That's a lot of good work you are doing there. Let us know how the doctor's appointment goes, if you care to share.",

She moved on so quickly that I am completely confused, angry, upset. I am still grieving the loss of what could have been a family with a nice home. Since the stress of leaving I have periods of Greif and general depression but I have also had worrying Bi-Polar symptoms. Myself as a coping mechanism found love online (of what I thought at the time) someone from overseas.. I sent some money after days and months of talking. I even went to the lengths of buying an airline ticket and meanwhile at the same time managing to keep \"normal\" behavior away from what I thought was a great way of helping someone and possibly bringing them to my country now I realize I was highly manic (though not psychotic) Over time I slowly realized the online love was nothing but me sending small amounts of money to a sociopath.. My mind wanted to not believe this though but also I felt cheated AGAIN after what had happened with my marriage, I also felt like all the time invested in those fake emotions online I could have thought about plans with my son in my spare time. I started doing more healthy things like seeing my old friends playing golf going for walks and enjoying and cherishing the times I am with my son. I finally deleted the contact of my online \"girlfriend\" 3 weeks ago and vowed to not contact again after she threatened to tell my wife on Facebook everything I had said to her....I also got a flight credit.. The last 3 weeks though I have fallen into a deep depression much more morbid than usual. That is why I decided to find this forum and ask for some help to see if anyone else suffers my symptoms in a Depressive relapse?? In the past I have suffered this symptom which can be highly stressful, it has happened after every stressor in my life and sometimes before a psychosis. I have constant negative intrusive thoughts of almost everything I look at sometimes linking colors to objects then fearing certain colors even though I know it is nonsense. My thoughts just make up fears for no reason instead of enjoying tasks and just getting through the day and thinking of ideas and having fun as I was, I just feel frozen withdrawn and can't daydream good thoughts and ideas anymore. A few days ago I had my first panic attack in 17 years all this came out of the stress I think from the past year and too much thinking but at the same time I don't know if it's Depression, OCD or even PTSD?? Please help How are you doing? I remember my days of severe depression with psychosis involved.  It has to be pretty bad to get to that point for me.  Depression has different levels of severity.  For me, psychosis was pretty bad, such as I need to be hospitalized to become stable again.  Comparing my moods to yours, I fluctuated in how my moods would go up and slightly depressed, really depressed and less depressed.  Never level, or normal.  That to me was an indication that my meds needed tweaking and I needed intervention in the form of seeing my therapist and taking care of myself too like sleeping better with the help of sleep aids.  My doctor had me on Seroquel for a short time then later something else.  Whatever it is that your doctor prescribes to you, is what you need to take.  Asking for help is the first step.  Speak up, always, these doctors are good people but they can't read minds.  You are worth so much!!!  I am very sorry that you are going through so much.  Big cyber hug! As for the online romantic thing.  I have a friend who lost over $12,000 to someone she learned to care for very much.  There were promises made.  She had just lost her husband.  She was widowed and vulnerable.  She is ok and she has moved on.  This happened years ago.  You are not the only one.  I know her on a personal level.  So, don't be so hard on yourself for being human.",
      "Thankyou for your replys they are very helpfull in my recovery process. Any tips and ways I can inprove my state I am very very greatfull of I went and saw my docter yesterday and looked at a medication review. I am currently on the highest dose of Valpro and Lamictal also 50mg Topamax so there is not too much room for movement apart from possibly adding another mood stabliser. The docter told me to have a think about it as I have improved slightly since my last visit 2 weeks ago, though I am still in a zoned out state. My docter \"and myself\" agrees that it is a buildup of stress and my bodys coping mechanism to not deal with any more trauma to then withdraw though at the same time I have a negative outlook on life due to a depression relapse. I have been keeping up exercising daily \"going for 1 hour walks every second day, kicking ball and being in the garden with my son, playing golf, playing drums, still trying to go out shopping (though feeling overwelmed by my surroundings) and working from home (slower paced) My docter said the recovery process will most likely take 3 months. I definately feel an improvement because I feel some windows of time that my mind can think of happy memories or drift of again and think of what to do later in the day (which is healthy and feels like a relief) so now my mind does not feel so frozen anymore but I feel it will take time.",
      "I am glad you got to talk to your doctor."

      "That do not involve hallucinogens. The TL;DR is that the FDA has approved a pill that combines the cough suppressant dextromethorphan with a little buproprion (Wellbutrin).  It's the cough medicine that actually relieves the depression, and the Wellbutrin component slows the metabolizing of the dextromethophan and keeps it active. https://youtu.be/ESvvAMWXuM4"

      "Another video from Dr Campbell.  I'm really not pushing this dude in particular, I just like the way he collects and aggregates data, then presents it in a form even I can understand. The TL;DR here is that some startups and university studies are indicating psychedelics as a future treatment for depression and anxiety. Some trials have combined pretty heavy drugs with therapy in a controlled psychedelic experience that is thought to make the brain more plastic and 'resettable'.  This would be a day patient kind of treatment that would involve 20 minutes or so of being in a hallucinogenic state under the supervision of medical professionals. Other trials have focused on microdosing psychedelics, notably mushroom compounds but also I think I saw LSD and MDMA mentioned- these would be self-administered doses well below the amounts that could cause a 'trip'.  These have shown to improve depression and anxiety and in the case of the mushroom compound (Psilocybin) there seem to be no detrimental health effects, short or long term, in healthy adults.  Also in older adults it happened to improve psychomotor control.  I could use some of that, ha. The microdosing also seems to dramatically reduce the desire/need for alcohol and nicotine consumption.  And this is all without actually being functionally affected in the form of any kind of trip or hallucination. Campbell's thought is that these will become mainstream but won't necessarily make SSRIs obsolete, as doctors work out what presentations call for what therapeutic route. https://youtu.be/2LN6LJiXqWs"

      "I've never been good at keeping friends. I attract a lot of people for how friendly and upbeat I always try to be. Many get eager to be my friend because I'm so much fun on the surface, but when they actually get to know me and realize I struggle with a lot issues, then it's \"... oh.\" They don't usually stick around for long. It 's not like I'm such a downer that my problems are all I talk about. Most of them I don't even tell I have clinical depression and anxiety. But I can only act like I'm always fine for so long and then they sort of just figure out that I'm actually not that much fun to have as a friend. Part of me blames myself for inadvertently fooling people into believing that I'm this cheery person all the time. Then again, people just suck. I just wish I could hold on to friends instead of always losing more than I gain.",
      "not sure if ur still looking for replies. but i cant be cheerful eve for a day. i have very few online friends. and they know of my depression. it get too tiring to maintain a facade. i avoid situations where i'm supposed to be cheerful.",
      "Yeah something I learned being around people too. Things get to heavy they go. Good friends will stay, but they can be hard to find. If you want keep friends my best advice is to hide the depressive side from your friends... at least until you can trust them and they become close friends you can trust that way you won't get hurt. Just my advice from my own personal experience dealing with Depression all my life.",
      "Same. they all hate me. -- Fri Aug 26, 2022 8:21 pm -- Probably for good reason... I'm too *sensitive*.",
      "it's a dance, in my opinion.  They have to be the right sort of folks that aren't just 'good time' people.  But also we have to be reasonably personable.  It is the grease of social interaction.  I have to try and not be so damned blunt- which is difficult for me.  Also I tend to be personally selfish- I mean I have to remember to be there for others when they need a friend. And also I have to try to keep more than just a little of my whinging to myself.  I use PF for whinging I've never been one to have many friends, but I'm also the kind of person that doesn't seem to need many- at least not in the flesh and blood.  Online I'm more sensitive to that kind of thing and will glom onto others in a way I don't in the flesh world.  Perhaps because I wear a mask in everyday life, I don't know.  Meh."

      "So I have this unusual symptom that's really been puzzling to me. I experience abdominal pain and anguish when I do things or even think about doing things. Even quite positive things I might otherwise enjoy, like reading, drawing, or watching a video. Almost everything triggers this pain and anguish. If I were to ignore and push through this pain and force myself to do many things, it could put me into an intense depression. It makes it extremely difficult for me to maintain any hobbies. Has anyone ever heard of or experienced anything like this? Is there a name for it, specifically? I mean, I've heard of anhedonia, but that's described as the absence of pleasure/enjoyment. I don't hear about it causing pain.",
      "Rather than being directly related to depression, could this be an anxiety thing, I wonder? While I haven't heard of physical pain, I know in the OCD forum some folks will get wound up so tight about whatever it is they're anxious about (in the forums, often related directly or indirectly with intrusive harm thoughts) that they feel intense mental anguish at enjoying anything.  It's as if they're determined to no longer enjoy little pleasures they once had.  They seem to associate the enjoyment with the object of their angst. Which isn't what you're saying here, I know- still it seems familiar enough that it makes me raise an eyebrow.  My reasoning would be that I've seen plenty of what I just wrote above; coupled with anxiety can cause some of the darndest physical symptoms and just when I think my own anxiety has manifested itself every physical way imaginable, it comes up with something new I hadn't thought of; and then finally the way that depression and anxiety are often co-morbid. Thus, I wonder if this couldn't be tied into some anxiety disorder.  I could be completely wrong of course, but it's my kneejerk reaction to your post.",

      "I heard that quote somewhere and it stuck with me. Right now it really applies because no one wants me. I'm ether a means to an end, to much of a hassle or just a complication. I know I'm just badly depressed. I was doing ok when I reached out for help and was talking to some professionals online. But they got frustrated with me constantly, not understanding what I was talking about or that I just needed to talk. They seemed to only be intrested if I was thinking suicide. No one understands BPD no one understands DID. I cant get help from the NHS because of family that work there. I cant afford private. I'm just a problem no one can be bothred to deal with. Triggers*****suiside, death**** At least if I'm dead my so called partner can stay with the girl he is dating. He saids he wants to try again when it's possible to travel. But he cant deal with the distance, what's stopping him from coming here then going to her when he is back home. Nothing. Im mentally deranged but not stupid. If I'm dead my parents can get that house they always wanted. Only reason dad likes keeping me around is so I can pay for them. I'm worthless and pointless otherwise. I have nothing, I am nothing. I'm just a nobody who's only worth comes from the money I urn. Working overtime constantly for no other reason than to escape. Even if it leaves me so withered I cant do anything. Death sounds so good, to sleep forever. Trigger ******end***** Its just though. It's only ever thoughts. I'm just crippled with nothingness. When boi fuzed, happed a while ago but I've just tried to ignore it. Hopped that he would re appear. So happy and joyfull. If he is part of me I'm ashamed because I cant be like him. I'm tired of fighting and getting no where. I'm not like syra who would always fight and pick themselves up. I'm so tired, no one cares. No one wants to care. I'm just here for others who dont want me. Sorry if I upset anyone here",
      "Hugs. Well you're worth more than you feel at the moment.  Intellectually, I know I am worth more, even if I don't feel like it (and I don't, so you're not alone).

I recently got on Lexapro (three weeks ago, I really haven't noticed any changes yet other than I've lost my brain-to-mouth filter in forums and I am running sentences forever... like I just did) and of course, he told me he was required to ask if I had thoughts of harming myself or others. I have OCD harm themes.  Thoughts of suicide/killing sprees are kinda what I do, frequently- but I didn't know how understanding of that he'd be so we just sort of answered No.  Only a half-lie- no serious thoughts of doing harm- I've managed to not act on them in over 40 years, so I think I'm pretty safe. TheHiveMind wrote: At least if I'm dead my so called partner can stay with the girl he is dating. Not to tell you what to do, but my kneejerk reaction is to have a bad attitude.

Actually I am trying to change and do some more healthy habits- I'm trying to kickstart walking every day- it does make a person feel pretty good, when I can make myself do it. I think I understand the feeling of nothingness- I was already at that point, then my employer sacked the entire facility, leaving me... well, like you, my worth had been hinged on being able to support my partner monetarily- I feel as if I have little worth otherwise- I'm just too messed up.  And now I don't even have that.  Coasting along for a couple years then hardship is gonna hit if I don't get my tail in gear, and I'm just not motivated.

I finally came up with my own theory about that, and tell folks in that forum look- you really don't want to kill yourself, you want to run away from yourself.  And of course, no matter how fast you run, there you still are.  So the brain gets frantic, looking for a way out- and suicide is the best it can come up with, that's all.  No more, no less.  That's what it comes up with in the moment.  In the moment, because nothing is forever- including the anxiety, the hopelessness, the depression, etc.  Nothing on this Earth is permanent. But your brain's feeling backed into a corner and that's just the place it goes. And that... sort of defangs it a little, for me.  I don't worry about having suicidal ideation because I know living organisms are you know, instincted (new word I just made up) to stay alive as long as possible.  I don't really want to kill myself- I just want to run away and make the anxiety STOP.  Which really isn't the same thing. Make that man decide between you and another girl- that's on him, and nothing to do with you as a person.  I don't know what to say about your parents.  I'm hoping that you're looking through the lens of depression and it's really not all that with them. Hang in there.",

Yes suicide is like that for me, just a way to escape the pain. When it gets to much, that's the first thought. Everything is so complicated at the moment. Covid ruined everything. It's why my relashionship is in tatters. It's not as simple as him choosing which one. Never would be, would it. Because life isnt like that. Really messed with my head how it dorsnt follow a logical pattern. There is no predicted outcome because I cant process it. I'm a mental wreck who cant think properly.

Life has to go on eventually. But for me it accelerated ruination that was already possibly in the cards.  It was an excuse to shut down my place of work permanently.  Meh. TheHiveMind wrote: It's not as simple as him choosing which one. Never would be, would it. Because life isnt like that. Why isn't it simple?  It's as easy as an ultimatum.  I've had them presented to me, before- and I chose wisely.  Very simple, nothing complicated about it, when the unpleasant consequences for an unwise action are spelled out.  It's been said that we get what we tolerate. Granted, with multiples some might be more.. tolerating than others- so yeah I reckon the system needs to be on the same page.  But.. if Momma ain't happy, no one is, and he needs to understand that."

      "If this is in the wrong forum, let me know. Much like a lot of people, my mental health has taken a hit due to covid as of recent. Back in 2019 I decided I wanted to get back into healthcare. I was 100% sure that this was what I wanted to do. I completed some classes in person with the remainder of the classes being online (which wasn't due to covid, that's just how the program was laid out). I started the practicum portion just a few months ago, and while it has been smooth sailing since I started, completing everything I need to complete and feeling confident for the most part in my abilities, I am getting more and more anxious and overwhelmed having to deal with the challenges of covid. Prior to having to be in a hospital setting, I chose to only watch the news or read articles regarding covid to keep myself informed which wasn't much as I was self employed. I use to immerse myself in it way too much in the beginning to the point where I felt my mental health was suffering as a result, so I took a step back. I feel like I am back at that point again, immersed in it too much, as everyday it is a constant reminder that we are still in this pandemic with no real end in sight. Masking 40+ hours a week, multiple emails a day containing information about stats and vaccines, constant talk between staff and even patients about covid. I'm just finding it all to be a bit much. I also don't have family or friends in the place where my practicum is taking place as I had to relocate. While I've been able to Zoom, text, and talk on the phone to people, it's just not the same. I'm nearing the end of my practicum and entire course and intend on finishing, but I'm just having trouble visualizing a future in healthcare when my anxiety continues to increase and my depression gets worse, with no real idea of when we will be able to go back to normal. Or if that is even a possibility. It's exhausting as well because I was hoping that this would get me back on my feet. I'm not in my 20s anymore, and the thought of having to start over again with something new (which I wouldn't even know where to begin) is scary. Any advice or thoughts is appreciated. I know so many people who are mentally drained at this point.",
      "I'm surprised we didn't have a sharp uptick during the worst of the Rona.  Of posters to the forums in general. Not sure how comfortable I'd feel in healthcare, myself- so take what I say with a grain of salt.  For me, once the thing became known- okay we know it spreads and what it is- I haven't wasted a lot of my anxiety on the bug itself.  I think a lot of entities play it up worse than it is.  Cui bono?  is something I'm always looking at. For me, this is a never-ending, really bad flu season.  I wash my hands more, I keep from touching my face as much as I can, and I wear a mask because it's good manners.  The end.  I'm probably medium to high risk for it being nasty if I get it, because I'm old and have breathing issues already- but I'm not going to hide under a rock.  I mean if a person isn't middle aged or older, the recovery rate is what, 99.something percent?  There's been a lot of fear-mongering.  I've sat at table in restaurant directly across from folks who got diagnosed with it like 10 days later, and I didn't get it.  I like my chances, and I take reasonable precautions.  Hand sanitizer is my friend. I live in a place that didn't stay completely shut down for long, and the half-measures in place are probably going to lift soon.  Whether things get back to 'normal' I think depends a lot on where you live.  I think some places seem to delight in never going back to 'normal', other places already have lifted all restrictions. If the healthcare feels too anxiety-prone for you, then you have to consider something else.  As far as starting all over, I'm having to think about going back to school, and I'm on the backside of 50.  Lost my job and no idea what I'm going to do, I got used to actually making money for a change, and it's going to be rough as I approach 60, to find something that pays decent.  But I have to do something- so I will.  If... you need to change from one field to another- humans are resilient creatures, more than we often give ourselves credit for being.  We will both get through this, even if we can't see how right now."

      "I have been prescribed zoloft 50mg for depression and anxiety. Anyone else who has been on this? first few days of taking it, I have been waking up a few times in the night, feeling more depersonalised than before. nausea...but on the upside a more stable mood.",
      "Yes I’ve taken it. You can decide to keep taking it or not but you should be properly informed. Effects of SSRI’s such as Zoloft include obesity, diebetes, heart disease, mania, agitation and it even has a black box warning that it can increase suicides. These drugs are addicting and will cause an addiction. Corporate clinical trials which have been cherry picked, and have a lot of problems give needed to treat numbers around 8. This means for every 8 people taking these drugs 1 will get a benefit from them. The rest are harmed with no benefits. Studies that correct for some of the flaws in corporate clinical trials find SSRI’s do not improve outcomes. Studies done independent find in the long term SSRI’s significantly worsen your outcome. One outcome measure found taking an SSRI increased your chance of becoming disabled by 50%.",
      "I am on Sertraline (Zoloft) and it has been successful for me. Don't draw any conclusions about it until your body can adjust to it. Give it a few months to build up in the system, unless you notice any severe or harmful side-effects. Not everyone will experience the listed common side-effects. Everyone is different. I recently went from 75mg to 100mg. I have been complimented on my behavior. People note that I seem more relaxed and social. My racing thoughts and the music in my head have subsided for the most part. Sleep has improved and I can concentrate better. Best of luck to you.",
      "It’s so personal with these drugs, I tried Zoloft and I had too many sides, switched to lexapro and it didn’t work for me and I was wicked lethargic, now I’m on Prozac and I think I’ve finally found the right one for me.  If your depression is bad enough that it takes away from living life than it’s worth a shot imo I’m not a Dr so don’t take that as medical advice it’s just my opinion",
      "We should really take what's best for us because every individual is different. One may work for someone and not for others."

      "Hi everyone, I'm new here and I didn't see a Presentation section, so I'll just go ahead with this topic. I am a man in my early thirties, got a PhD which contributed to my depression together with a very difficult family history, I am currently starting to work as a teaching assistant in schools, and at present I have ups and downs. The reason I am writing here now is that I am struggling with the strong anger, sometimes bordering on hate, towards so many people in my life, since I seem to keep constantly meeting people who make my situation worse. I have had to emigrate because my home country did not offer any prospects for someone with my academic curriculum. I had to go away as soon as possible, and I have to stay away, because I have abusive, lying and unreliable family member whom I cannot trust and who cannot be the material nor the emotional presence I need. I am now distant from most of my closest friend, both from before my PhD and the ones I met during my PhD, because they are all abroad. Recently I have lost my chances to get into teacher training this academic year, after several years of delays due to my mental condition. This has happened because my former PhD supervisor is notoriously unreliable and submitted her mandatory reference with a 2-months delay. Currently I live with an unbearable housemate, who is extremely narcissistic and disorderly, and who constantly tries to shift blames on me for everything that happens in the house (leaking pipes, malfunctioning appliances, his own disorder), who never willingly reciprocates the constant favours he asks for, and who is extremely needy and always wants to have people around but treats them like cr+p. He is also very intrusive, to the point of walking into bedrooms and bathrooms whenever he feels he needs to do so for whateve reason. I had to have another fight with him today because he things a broken door handle is my responsibility to fix, but would not accept my feedback on what is or is not working. As I am trying to be more firm, I have to be quite nasty with this guy and this is ultimately unpleasant for everyone. I know this latter point sounds petty, but really he is an unbearable housemate who has already caused at least 3 former housemates to move out, and who has basically lost all of his friends because of his weird character. Luckily now he's moving out because he got his own place. I am saying all of this to illustrate my problem: I have been repeatedly betrayed, disappointed, hindered in my personal and professional efforts by basically every single person in my life (and I did omit the betrayals and unreliability of my girlfriend during my PhD years). Even when I decided that I was going to just focus on myself and let myself have fun, I got into un unbearable living situation with a narcissistic intrusive person, and stuck by a pandemic! I have mostly overcome my former hatred for my difficult life and a universe that seems to hinder even the most basic attempts at a decent life. I can take the partial randomness of things. I find some kind of spiritual consolation and even motivation in a form of pantheism. But the constant disappointment towards people, with their pettiness and selfishness and outright disregard of consequences and other people out of either stupidity or unreliability, all of this really disturbs me. It's easy to be diagnosed as depressed. But what if this is just a very normal reaction to constant, repeated circumstances of physical, emotional, and even moral distress? I mean, I find it so hard to have to constantly struggle with absolutely everything and everyone! I just wish there were a kind of emotional \"nest\" where I can retreat, and recharge my energies while relying one someone else's support every once in a while, when I'm hurt and weakened. But I am denied that. And the more I try, the more this gets denied. I may have found a more generic existential consolation, but I have been unable to get any human consolation no matter how hard I tried. And it really leaves me empty inside. I basically just hate how stupid and selfish people are. Sorry if this sounds angsty. It's no consolation knowing, rationally, that not everyone is. The fact is that I have tried too many times now. My energies are dried out, my willingness to keep risking it is almost gone. I want to be good with people, and I want this goodness to lead somewhere nice for all people involved, but it really does not seem to work that way / if you act kindly, you get crushed, if you react all the time, you feel sour and drained. So why should one keep playing russian roulette when at every new failed attempt the damage piles up? Is there any alternative to fill up this void?"

      "Hello all, it's exactly as the title says, I feel like I'm doomed to failure. I'm 23 and still not entirely certain what I want to do with my life (I have some ideas I guess but I'm not sure). It feels like no matter what I do I'm destined to become nothing but a burden on my family and society. I have no boyfriend, I've never really been in a relationship. My life is passing me by and I fear I will end up an old maid, all alone. I fear I will never truly do anything with my life, that I will wind up spending the rest of my life living at home with my parents, never getting a job or getting married or starting a family of my own. All because of my stupid anxiety and depression and lack of self-esteem (my ugly appearance doesn't help either). I fear my parents will pass away, disappointed in me, and I will be all alone. Like I said, I'm not entirely certain what I want to do with my life, I have no boyfriend, no plans. Even my friends have mostly drifted away from me and I rarely speak to any of them. There is one friend I still see and speak to on a fairly regular basis, but even she seems to be drifting away sometimes (and is struggling with her own depression and anxiety). I feel like I am almost cursed. I try to tell myself that these thoughts are irrational, that the idea of being cursed in irrational, but it's difficult to change my feelings. I know rationally there's no such thing as curses, and i don't actually believe in them, but sometimes it feels like I am cursed. Like no matter what I do I am doomed to fail and waste my life away. Does anybody else feel like this sometimes? What can I do to change my mind, to stop feeling like I am doomed? I feel trapped in a cycle of failure where I feel like I am doomed to fail and thus I do fail, but how am I supposed to change that? How can I change my expectations when the outcome is the same? Idk, I'm just rambling now. Please help.",
      "I think just about everybody feels like that at some time or another.  I know I feel that way a lot, most of my life up until my older 30s I could have written that post with just a few minor changes. Well, let's see in no particular order.  It's super hard to get out of depression, I know.  I probably have what would be called clinical depression.  No official Dx but every time I take a self-evaluation it screams at me to go get help NOW before I do something to myself (pretty sure if I was going to do that, I'd have done it by now). Job... well me and jobs don't get along, but I like to eat.  I mean, sooner or later you just have to grit your teeth, and stick your neck out, and if you fail at one thing, you have to find something else. Boyfriends... relationships... no confidence in yourself or your looks.  been there done that- I'm Bi and was born male but yeah no confidence and I ain't pretty.  Um... spent a lot of lonesome nights thinking a relationship meant everything.  Now that I'm in one, I find it's not everything my mind set it up to be.  It's a lot of work, for one thing.  Also it didn't 'fix' me. Mind you I'm not complaining, I do like being with someone, that's the natural human desire right? Just that it's not a miracle cure for Life. but that is a digression (and a warning against disillusionment).   the point being that I was alone, and a virgin, well into my 30s.  And then I got tired of it.  When I got tired enough of it, and decided to not worry about my looks, or worry about how I felt about myself, or worry about rejection... a relationship happened!  When I quit hiding, in other words. For me, it just takes being tired enough of where you are, to step into something that might be better.  Nothing's without risk, but without taking some risk, heck if left to myself I'd be curled up in a fetal position in an underground bunker worried about asteroids hitting the earth.  That's no way to live. Mind you I'm still awful at 'living'.  I'm avoidant as hell and still depressed and generally hate myself and all the rest, but I mean sometimes you just have to say screw it I'm going to try and live a little."

      "hi, i think it's vague when people say to exercise to help with depression, at least it's vague when the depression is due to the incident. i'd want the psychologist to address the issue rather than suggest exercise or other stuff. that's diversion. it's like ur body lacks proteins and ur suggesting carbs to repair the body. again. it may help when the cause of depression isn't any incident /trauma. but for me (depression after an incident), i'd want the doc to address the issue."

      "Anhedonia is the inability to feel a sense of pleasure or reward from things you would normally feel rewarded or pleased by. I don't think anhedonia is its own disorder, but the term is used clinically sometimes. I have anhedonia and I wanted to see if anybody feels the same. I'm stuck doing nothing because I can't make myself care because nothing brings a sense of reward. I was supposed to write an article for work this morning but I didn't, even though writing articles and essays used to make me feel good in the past. The thought of pay from work doesn't motivate me either. Because I don't really care what happens to me. My dad is taking care of 90% of my finances and I'm just trying to do a little writing job on the side because it's all I can do. But I can see my future. I'll leech off dad until he dies or can't make money anymore. Because even though I love dad, I just can't care about work. Work and money do not bring me any sense of accomplishment. Then, I suspect my older sister would take me in with the expectation that I work part time. I will fail at the job like I always do because I don't care enough to go. After that, my sister will tire of me. Eventually I'll be homeless. And that thought doesn't even scare me. I don't care. I don't want to do anything because nothing is *worth doing. It's easy to say \"just do it anyway,\" and a part of me is clinging to that, which is why I haven't tried to kill myself in 5 months. But it's not enough. I'm not doing what I should be doing. I'm unhappy with myself. Yet I can't help it. I just don't care.",
      "i used to feel unhappy with stuff i otherwise enjoyed. i still feel but that's okay. i try not to give my unhappiness that much importance. i'm not all cheerful and delighted about life, but its better than earlier. you may not want to do stuff, or may not care but still its better to do stuff. i did not care about my earlier job and left it. wasted 3 years of my life and now when i look back i regret not taking work seriously. i would've been at a good post now, would've had a stable career by now. you may not care now, but later on you may start to care. and at times we have to do stuff even if we dont care. like most of the time i hate to eat food. but i just eat a fruit cause that's easier n quick to eat. i dont care but i need to eat it. my body needs the nutrients. and frankly no one is passionate about life/career. people have fun in other areas of life. like friends, movies. with depression its hard to be happy or smile. so everything feels worthless. it may be. could be that it's all just a waste. but its better to do stuff than live a blank life and regret later. at least thats what i think.",
      "I'm also experiencing anhedonia, as I'm experiencing a depressive episode (I have bipolar disorder). It makes me feel sadder to have \"lost\" interests that normally I enjoy, but I remind myself that the depression will go away at some point, along with anhedonia. Take care.",

      "I find life dull and pointless and every day I have to go into my work feels like I’m living a pointless tragedy. I was on the bus this morning as the sun was rising and thought about how nice it would be to go for a walk. But instead I was going into a dark office, where I won’t leave until after the sun goes down again. My work is not so bad but it is just so boring and utterly pointless. If the company I worked for closed tomorrow, nobody would care. While the work is not nasty or evil, it provides absolutely nothing of value to society. I’ve been here for four years and each day feels more worthless than the last. What is the point of staying alive to do this crap for the next 30, 40 years? All day long I have to listen to my co-workers talking and it hurts my head. All I want is quiet. I asked could I do my job from home, even a couple of days a week, which I can see no reason against but they said no. To be honest, home life isn’t great either. Me and my girlfriend are very different and this is becoming more of an issue as time goes by. She is so outgoing and when we’re off work all she wants to do is go out and talk. But I’m so tired all the time. All I want to do is hang out with my dog and play video games. They’re two of the few things that bring me happiness now. But usually I’m dragged out somewhere I don’t want to be and my girlfriend gets angry with me for being in a bad mood or wanting to go home early. We’re both in our 30s now and I really thought she’d be after calming down by now but she always wants to socialise. She actually said that going out is who she is and I am so sick of it. We’ve been together for nearly five years and I don’t know what to do.",
      "hi hardtoexpress, You seem to need a job that has more sense to you. can you investigate that way? You can think on the long run - job takes much time in your life. Maybe you can build an other activity? It can take time but is worth looking for it... Once you are more happy with what you want to do, it could make you feel better with yourself. (Probably in the last monthes your girlfriend  had to stay home too? how did you two cope with that?)"

      "Do people not understand that emotional pain can be just as bad as physical pain? I don't have the proper money needed to get the years worth of specialized therapy to even have a fighting chance and people think that just popping prescribed pills are going to help. I have terrible reactions to the meds but my moods are stabilized. I feel that it just makes it easier for everyone else. I've lost 6 friends this past week. I'm so lonely. I'm so drugged out on all the pills they've put me on and nobody really seems to care. Because they never really did.",

      "Hi guys, In the past all I've wanted is to not be alone. But now I'm in a great marriage and life is generally good and all I want is to be alone to sit in my depression. I saw someone and starting working on my crap in college. And life just got in the way once I graduated. I think I've always had some form of low grade depression my whole life and I've been very good at hiding everything. Since January, I've started to sense it creeping back up on me. But now I'm not alone all I want to do is be alone with my depression and just live in that hole alone. Im unable to express any of this to my husband and honestly I don't want to. So am I just going to have to resign myself to smush this down and continue pretending for the rest of my life? Does anyone else experience this?",
      "i am in a better place than i once was but inside i'm depressed and like to remain alone. i have told a few friends about the depression so they are okay with it. they dont coerce me into social events as they're aware of my mental health. i'm also into therapy. Im unable to express any of this to my husband and honestly I don't want to. So am I just going to have to resign myself to smush this down and continue pretending for the rest of my life? Does anyone else experience this? if you cant tell this to your husband, tell this to someone else. perhaps start therapy. the depression may not magically disappear but it'll be easier to cope with. i still have super gloomy days but there are also pleasant moments few and far between. if you dont tell this anyone or seek help and if you try to smush this down, you'll end up worsening your health. there is a cycle-8 of depression and anger. the more depressed a person is, the more angry/irritated the person gets. the person feels angry at life going by. anger causes outbursts which causes regrets. more depression. dont smush it down. talk to someone. this forum isnt really the equivalent of professional help. sure it helped me a lot, but the right therapist or even a great friend with great insight can be helpful."

      "Recently, I had a bit of an epiphany, I think. When I was a kid, I looked forward to the future. The future seemed bright, and full of possibility. Then one day, I'm not sure when exactly but sometime during adolescence I guess, I stopped looking forward to the future. The future became something unknown and bleak, and I stopped looking forward to it. As a kid, I looked forward to when I would someday be in high school. I saw TV shows with teenage protagonists and thought that high school would be like that. I thought that I would find love, date someone, and have amazing adventures with my friends. Of course I also saw the high school drama on those TV shows, but it was glamorized. I thought high school drama would be fun and exciting, a world of intrigue, but it wasn't. I got to high school and was sorely disappointed. Nobody was interested in me romantically, and all I got was crippling low self-esteem. Something similar happened with college. I wasn't as naive as I was back when I was a kid, but I guess I hoped that once I got to college it would be a fresh start and that I would make lots of friends, experiment, and grow as a person. I thought that it would be exciting, and I would become more confident, but very little changed. I just recently got my bachelor's degree, and I'm pretty much the same person I was back then. Back when I first graduated high school. And now...? Now I don't know. I'm going for my master's degree in the Fall, provided this pandemic doesn't ###$ everything up even more than it already has. It's hard to look forward to the future. To see a bright and shining future ahead of me. I'm reminded of that one song by Bowling For Soup, \"High School Never Ends\". What can I do? How can I break out of this depression? How can I start to look forward again?",
      "even i thought high school would be fun. i literally did slow walk down the stairs in school, hoping some 'drama team' would recognize me. i guess the future comes from the present. ask urself what subjects are you interested in? would you like to do a phd in that subject later? would u like to join the sports team of the college or the drama team? see if you can find a couple of students from that college on social media. some seniors. perhaps you can interact with them so you get a clear idea about the college."

      "Does anyone else ever get this way, and if so what do you do to break free of this negative spiral? It's like Depression-ception, heh. I have depression and anxiety, and then I get more depressed because I feel guilty about having depression and anxiety. I feel guilty because of the way it affects/has affected my parents and the ones I care about. It's better now than it was before, but in the past I would have constant panic attacks and caused my parents a lot of grief because of that. Not only did I inconvenience them by forcing them to help me calm down, but I caused them pain because they care about me. And even now, though my anxiety has improved immensely thanks to a combination of medicine and therapy, I still struggle with low self-esteem and depression. And I'm sure that, even if they don't really say it, my parents are suffering because of that. Because they care about me and don't want to see me suffer. And if I apologize (once or twice I did apologize to them for not being a better daughter) it only makes them feel worse. They're suffering because of me and there's nothing I can do about it. I can't even apologize for it without making them feel worse. In some ways, I really do feel like they deserve a better daughter than I can be. When I was a child, I guess you could say I was abused by my older brother. He often bullied and harassed me. He told me, directly and indirectly, to basically not be a burden to my parents. Maybe that's where my guilt complex comes from, haha. Once, when I was in high school and was having an especially hard time with my anxiety (it got so bad I couldn't even leave the house) he told me in the middle of a panic attack that I was killing our parents. That I was killing mom and dad, shortening their lives, because of my anxiety, because of how much I stressed them out. I admit, back when my anxiety was pretty bad but not bad enough to prevent me from leaving the house, I did call my mom to my high school several times because I was having a panic attack. I interrupted her grocery shopping (and other shopping trips), and forced her to come to the school to calm me down. I might've even interrupted her when she was at work a few times, with my panic attacks back in middle and high school. When my anxiety got so bad that I could no longer leave the house, that was when my parents took me to a psychiatrist to get medication (before that I was seeing a psychologist, but he couldn't prescribe me medication). Thankfully, that medication helped a lot and, with the help of my therapist and my devoted parents, I was able to eventually go out again and go back to school, and get my life back. I was able to return to normal, no, better than normal, thanks to medication and my family and my psychologist. I'm eternally in their debt for that. Still, I seem to have gotten way off topic and into a pity party. Sorry about that. Anyway, thanks a lot to anyone who's stuck around for this long lol. TL;DR: I feel guilty for having depression and anxiety and causing the people who care about me pain and inconvenience. Then I get more depressed. Some days I feel like a failure and like I will never make anything of myself or go anywhere with my life. Like I'll become one of those 40-year-old virgins living in my parents' basement. I wish I were a better daughter. I wish my brain weren't so effed up. What can I do to fix this? How can I stop feeling so bad? And how can I make up for all the pain and suffering I've caused merely by existing and being me? Thank you for taking the time to read and respond to this!",

Feeling guilt for everything you do (or don't do) as well as feeling like you're a failure are both typical symptoms of depression. Learning to stop (or decrease) the self-crucifixion will help. If you haven't looked into Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) with your therapist yet, it may be of interest - especially the Mindfulness component and Emotional Regulation. There's also a lot of info and worksheets on Google, YouTube's DBT Peer Connections (among others) briefly cover the modules. It was originally for chronically suicidal individuals and BPD, but has now expanding to many other areas like PTSD, cPTSD, bipolar disorder, addiction, chronic pain, and more Parts of DBT's Emotional Regulation look at slowly \"increasing positive experiences\" as a way of improving mood - and slowly \"building mastery\" as a way of increasing your sense of competence/confidence/independence which also should have a positive effect on mood. And, Parts of DBT's Mindfulness look at things like how one can decrease their suffering when decreasing the judgement in their perceptions and their distressing experiences. Obviously, it's also important to stay hooked in with your doctor or therapist to monitor whether the depression is getting worse or not."

Major Depressive Disorder Description Major depressive disorder (also known as recurrent depressive disorder, clinical depression, major depression, unipolar depression, or unipolar disorder) is a mental disorder characterized by an all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low self-esteem, and by loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. The term \"major depressive disorder\" was selected by the American Psychiatric Association to designate this symptom cluster as a mood disorder in the 1980 version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), and has become widely used since. The general term depression is often used to denote the disorder; but as it can also be used in reference to other types of psychological depression, it is disfavored over more precise terminology for the disorder in clinical and research use. Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, around 3.4% of people with major depression commit suicide, and up to 60% of people who commit suicide had depression or another mood disorder. Major Depressive Disorder DSM IV-TR Criteria Code: Select all Major Depressive Episode A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note:  Do note include symptoms that are clearly due to a general medical condition, or mood-incongruent delusions or hallucinations. (1) depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood. (2) markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others) (3) significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gains. (4) insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day (5) psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down) (6) fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day (7) feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick) (8) diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others) (9) recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide B. The symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode. C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism). E. The symptoms are not better accounted for by Bereavement, i.e., after the loss of a loved one, the symptoms persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation. Single Episode A.  Presence of a single Major Depressive Episode B.  The Major Depressive Episode is not better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder and is not superimposed on Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform Disorder, Delusional Disorder, or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. C. There has never been a Manic Episode, a Mixed Episode, or a Hypomanic Episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like, mixed-like, or hypomanic-like episodes are substance or treatment induced or are due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition. Major Depressive Disorder Recurrent A.  Presence of two or more Major Depressive Episodes. Note: To be considered separate episodes, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months in which criteria are not met for a Major Depressive Episode. B.   The Major Depressive Episodes are not better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder and are not superimposed on Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform Disorder, Delusional Disorder, or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. C.  There has never been a Manic Episode, a Mixed Episode, or a Hypomanic Episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like, mixed-like, or hypomanic-like episodes are substance or treatment induced or are due to the direct physiological effects or a general medical condition. Specify (for current or most recent episode): Severity/Psychotic/Remission Specifiers Chronic With Catatonic Features With Atypical Features With Postpartum Onset Specify Longitudinal Course Specifiers (With and Without Interepisode Recovery) With Seasonal Pattern American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. (c) 2000 American Psychiatric Association. http://www.psych.org/ ADHD ICD-10 Criteria Code: Select all F33 Recurrent Depressive Disorder The disorder is characterized by repeated episodes of depression as specified in depressive episode (mild, moderate, or severe), without any history of independent episodes of mood elevation and overactivity that fulfill the criteria of mania. However, the category should still be used if there is evidence of brief episodes of mild mood elevation and overactivity which fulfill the criteria of hypomania immediately after a depressive episode (sometimes apparently precipitated by treatment of a depression). The age of onset and the severity, duration, and frequency of the episodes of depression are all highly variable. In general, the first episode occurs later than in bipolar disorder, with a mean age of onset in the fifth decade. Individual episodes also last between 3 and 12 months (median duration about 6 months) but recur less frequently. Recovery is usually complete between episodes, but a minority of patients may develop a persistent depression, mainly in old age (for which this category should still be used). Individual episodes of any severity are often precipitated by stressful life events; in many cultures, both individual episodes and persistent depression are twice as common in women as in men. The risk that a patient with recurrent depressive disorder will have an episode of mania never disappears completely, however many depressive episodes he or she has experienced. If a manic episode does occur, the diagnosis should change to bipolar affective disorder. Recurrent depressive episode may be subdivided, as below, by specifying first the type of the current episode and then (if sufficient information is available) the type that predominates in all the episodes. Includes: recurrent episodes of depressive reaction, psychogenic depression, reactive depression, seasonal affective disorder recurrent episodes of endogenous depression, major depression, manic depressive psychosis (depressed type), psychogenic or reactive depressive psychosis, psychotic depression, vital depression Excludes: recurrent brief depressive episodes F32 Depressive Episode In typical depressive episodes of all three varieties described below (mild, moderate, and severe), the individual usually suffers from depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to increased fatiguability and diminished activity. Marked tiredness after only slight effort is common. Other common symptoms are: reduced concentration and attention; reduced self-esteem and self-confidence; ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode); bleak and pessimistic views of the future; ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide; disturbed sleep; diminished appetite. The lowered mood varies little from day to day, and is often unresponsive to circumstances, yet may show a characteristic diurnal variation as the day goes on. As with manic episodes, the clinical presentation shows marked individual variations, and atypical presentations are particularly common in adolescence. In some cases, anxiety, distress, and motor agitation may be more prominent at times than the depression, and the mood change may also be masked by added features such as irritability, excessive consumption of alcohol, histrionic behaviour, and exacerbation of pre-existing phobic or obsessional symptoms, or by hypochondriacal preoccupations. For depressive episodes of all three grades of severity, a duration of at least 2 weeks is usually required for diagnosis, but shorter periods may be reasonable if symptoms are unusually severe and of rapid onset. Some of the above symptoms may be marked and develop characteristic features that are widely regarded as having special clinical significance. The most typical examples of these \"somatic\" symptoms are: loss of interest or pleasure in activities that are normally enjoyable; lack of emotional reactivity to normally pleasurable surroundings and events; waking in the morning 2 hours or more before the usual time; depression worse in the morning; objective evidence of definite psychomotor retardation or agitation (remarked on or reported by other people); marked loss of appetite; weight loss (often defined as 5% or more of body weight in the past month); marked loss of libido. Usually, this somatic syndrome is not regarded as present unless about four of these symptoms are definitely present. The categories of mild, moderate and severe depressive episodes described in more detail below should be used only for a single (first) depressive episode. Further depressive episodes should be classified under one of the subdivisions of recurrent depressive disorder. These grades of severity are specified to cover a wide range of clinical states that are encountered in different types of psychiatric practice. Individuals with mild depressive episodes are common in primary care and general medical settings, whereas psychiatric inpatient units deal largely with patients suffering from the severe grades. Acts of self-harm associated with mood (affective) disorders, most commonly self-poisoning by prescribed medication, should be recorded by means of an additional code from Chapter XX of ICD-10 (X60-X84). These codes do not involve differentiation between attempted suicide and \"parasuicide\", since both are included in the general category of self-harm. Differentiation between mild, moderate, and severe depressive episodes rests upon a complicated clinical judgement that involves the number, type, and severity of symptoms present. The extent of ordinary social and work activities is often a useful general guide to the likely degree of severity of the episode, but individual, social, and cultural influences that disrupt a smooth relationship between severity of symptoms and social performance are sufficiently common and powerful to make it unwise to include social performance amongst the essential criteria of severity. The presence of dementia or mental retardation does not rule out the diagnosis of a treatable depressive episode, but communication difficulties are likely to make it necessary to rely more than usual for the diagnosis upon objectively observed somatic symptoms, such as psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite and weight, and sleep disturbance. Includes: single episodes of depression (without psychotic symptoms), psychogenic depression or reactive depression) F32.0 Mild Depressive Episode Diagnostic Guidelines Depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and increased fatiguability are usually regarded as the most typical symptoms of depression, and at least two of these, plus at least two of the other symptoms described above should usually be present for a definite diagnosis. None of the symptoms should be present to an intense degree. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. An individual with a mild depressive episode is usually distressed by the symptoms and has some difficulty in continuing with ordinary work and social activities, but will probably not cease to function completely. A fifth character may be used to specify the presence of the somatic syndrome: F32.00 Without somatic symptoms The criteria for mild depressive episode are fulfilled, and there are few or none of the somatic symptoms present. F32.01 With somatic symptoms The criteria for mild depressive episode are fulfilled, and four or more of the somatic symptoms are also present. (If only two or three somatic symptoms are present but they are unusually severe, use of this category may be justified.) F32.1 Moderate Depressive Episode Diagnostic Guidelines At least two of the three most typical symptoms noted for mild depressive episode should be present, plus at least three (and preferably four) of the other symptoms. Several symptoms are likely to be present to a marked degree, but this is not essential if a particularly wide variety of symptoms is present overall. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. An individual with a moderately severe depressive episode will usually have considerable difficulty in continuing with social, work or domestic activities. A fifth character may be used to specify the occurrence of somatic symptoms: F32.10 Without somatic symptoms The criteria for moderate depressive episode are fulfilled, and few if any of the somatic symptoms are present. F32.11 With somatic symptoms The criteria for moderate depressive episode are fulfilled, and four or more or the somatic symptoms are present. (If only two or three somatic symptoms are present but they are unusually severe, use of this category may be justified.) F32.2 Severe Depressive Episode Without Psychotic Symptoms In a severe depressive episode, the sufferer usually shows considerable distress or agitation, unless retardation is a marked feature. Loss of self-esteem or feelings of uselessness or guilt are likely to be prominent, and suicide is a distinct danger in particularly severe cases. It is presumed here that the somatic syndrome will almost always be present in a severe depressive episode. Diagnostic Guidelines All three of the typical symptoms noted for mild and moderate depressive episodes should be present, plus at least four other symptoms, some of which should be of severe intensity. However, if important symptoms such as agitation or retardation are marked, the patient may be unwilling or unable to describe many symptoms in detail. An overall grading of severe episode may still be justified in such instances. The depressive episode should usually last at least 2 weeks, but if the symptoms are particularly severe and of very rapid onset, it may be justified to make this diagnosis after less than 2 weeks. During a severe depressive episode it is very unlikely that the sufferer will be able to continue with social, work, or domestic activities, except to a very limited extent. This category should be used only for single episodes of severe depression without psychotic symptoms; for further episodes, a subcategory of recurrent depressive disorder should be used. Includes: single episodes of agitated depression, melancholia or vital depression without psychotic symptoms F32.3 Severe Depressive Episode With Psychotic Symptoms Diagnostic Guidelines A severe depressive episode which meets the criteria given for severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms and in which delusions, hallucinations, or depressive stupor are present. The delusions usually involve ideas of sin, poverty, or imminent disasters, responsibility for which may be assumed by the patient. Auditory or olfactory hallucinations are usually of defamatory or accusatory voices or of rotting filth or decomposing flesh. Severe psychomotor retardation may progress to stupor. If required, delusions or hallucinations may be specified as mood-congruent or mood-incongruent. Differential Diagnosis Depressive stupor must be differentiated from catatonic schizophrenia, from dissociative stupor, and from organic forms of stupor. This category should be used only for single episodes of severe depression with psychotic symptoms; for further episodes a subcategory of recurrent depressive disorder should be used. Includes: single episodes of major depression with psychotic symptoms, psychotic depression, psychogenic depressive psychosis, reactive depressive psychosis International Classification of Diseases (ICD), World Health Organization http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/",

      "Guys hello I am new here because I needed someone to share my story with and psychiatrist are something I can't afford right now. My whole problem begins with a break up , but please don't judge me. I know it is everyday thing and that I have to be stronger, but.. May 2019. I have had a boyfriend for 4 years, he was my best best friend. We had fun all the time, laughing, loving, everything was so easy. We didn't have to force anything. Everyone around us were saying that they wanted a relationship like ours. We had a long distance relationship, an hour away with a plane but we were seeing each other quite frequently and communicating all the time. I was during my med studies, he was studying economics there so it was actually good so we could focus on our education. Our plan was, after I finish med school, to come where he is and do my surgery specialization there. That was supposed to happen in January 2020. Then, out of nowhere, he said that he wanted a break, but I didn't agree because I don't believe in breaks and he broke up with me. We were planning our summer vacation two days before, and just like that he decided he wanted to break up. The reason he said was because the distance was too much.. we had only 6 months left until I come there. One week before that, he went out with friends that were visiting the town where he was and there was this girl he then met for the first time. A month after we broke up - they started seeing each other, they went on weekends together (that fast), they were buying gifts for each other, they even went public.. I had my doubts since the beginning but he was always denying them and lying. But then he confessed to me, said she was only sex ( yes, we were kind of communicating the whole time, mainly because we missed our friendship ). 6 months later, she told him she wanted a relationship, but he said to her that he couldn't let me go and that he wants to try again with me, that he never saw her as something more serious. And now we are on a track to get together again. But... After we broke up, I was devastated. I never ever expected something like that from him,he was always taking care of me. I felt like I lost the person I was closest too and the person who cared about me the most. I had suicide thoughts, I stopped hanging out with people.. This goes deeper, because my father was an alcoholic and physically abusive but died out of lung cancer, so I grow up learning how to take care of myself and I was quite individualistic person. Until I met him. Until he became my best friend and lover and I was like Hey ,relationships can actually work, someone can actually take care of me. And I never expected anything like this from him. Never. Ever. So I had a depression episode , I took antidepressants  but for two months only because they took away my concentration and focus. He has showed me their last conversation, where he says to her that he chooses me and she says Oh give it a month with her and you will see that we are soulmates, ours was love at first sign... I became obsessed with her,  she is prettier, she is more interesting, she is 4 years older then the both of us. She has always make up on. She is everything everything I am not. I don't recognize myself. I feel like this face is not mine, this hair is not mine so why take care of it. These toxic thoughts were never something that I had. I was a strong person, I went through a lot in my childhood, and now I am ashamed of myself. I can't stand myself. I feel like I only bother people and that I am boring. I have friends that have happy relationships and I envy them. I feel soooo guilty about that. I love them, I want them to be happy but I envy anyone who has a happy relationship now. I feel like I am not worth it, because after a night of meeting her - he decided she is worth of throwing our relationship away. And they also became close real fast, they went on weekends together, they bought each other presents. he even came secretly for a weekend at her town to visit her.. Something he has never done for me and I was always asking for. He said that he wanted to do something rascal, that he never consider her as serious until 5 days ago he said that he remembered the time with her and he doesn't feel good. I don't know what that meant because he got angry and pulled away. He says that he wants to end up with me, that we will work things out (we are not together, we are trying to work things out) but I am so scared that they are secretly communicating and that he will do that again and that I will not take it this time. I love him. I don't feel joy in the things I used to, but I feel joy when I am with him. I feel like I am at home. Only sometimes home is haunted by ghosts. I still think about ending my life mostly because I don't like who I have become.  I started having nightmares. Honestly I feel like everyone's life would be better off without me. Maybe no one will even notice if I am gone. Also I am scared that I will push him away with this behavior, because he says I am not the girl he fell in love with.. He is right. I really feel like I am not worth it. She used to tell everyone that it was love at first sign, that they were soulmates - and I don't know why but I am afraid of this. I am afraid of this being true and I am afraid that he wants to get back together so that he can say that we gave it another try.. Also now I have moved away from my city so the time has come for our plans and that is also why he maybe wants to try again. Because this was our plan. She said that she would even move for him. I feel so stupid for having these thoughts but I am so tired. I just want to be me again. Please don't judge me, I know people have worst problems, but I am so tired. I am begging God everyday to not wake up the next day. I want this to stop. I was always joyful, and brought the energy in the room. Even now people say that I am very positive person and that they can tell me everything and I listen to them and feel as if they are talking about someone else. How can you see me like that? I always wanted to be a surgeon but even the thought of that doesn't make me happy anymore. He says my insecurity and low self esteem are taking away his energy... And that is why I am even more afraid that he is secretly communicating with her because she is more stable I guess.. I just want my head to stop. I want to feel good again, I want to be me again. I don't want to be afraid",
      "But... After we broke up, I was devastated. I never ever expected something like that from him,he was always taking care of me. I felt like I lost the person I was closest too and the person who cared about me the most. I had suicide thoughts, I stopped hanging out with people.. how were you before you met him? i know its difficult but if he doesnt want to be with you, then you have to set him free and even yourself. instead of not hanging out with people, hang out with friends whom you can share your current situation with. i'm not suggesting 'get over it' or 'move on' or 'party/drink' but an honest conversation with a friend has helped me at times. I grow up learning how to take care of myself and I was quite individualistic person. earlier even i used to think that i can take care of myself. in fact i had some pride over myself that i dont need anyone. but now i realize it was shallow. its ok to not ask for help, but its not ok to feel proud over it. cause then we're disrespecting those who ask for help. just as some people are physically strong, some are emotionally strong and some are emotionally weak and that's okay. its ok to ask for help. i'd rather have honest friends with whom i can share my challenge than wear a superman mask and proclaim to never complain in life. I don't recognize myself. I feel like this face is not mine, this hair is not mine so why take care of it. maybe you've changed now. A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions-a quote from google. These toxic thoughts were never something that I had. I was a strong person, I went through a lot in my childhood, and now I am ashamed of myself. I can't stand myself. I feel like I only bother people and that I am boring. I have friends that have happy relationships and I envy them. I feel soooo guilty about that. I love them, I want them to be happy but I envy anyone who has a happy relationship now. reminds myself in 2013. after i had a nervous breakdown i was missing my former self so  much. i still do. i was the person who never whined, i was an achiever in life. what now i realize is that its ok to complain. its ok to be boring. its not your job to entertain others or wear a laughing face all the time. those are only for instagram status that 'be happy. yolo blah blah' if i'm feeling low, i'm going to accept it and not go to a party and dance. if people think you bother them by telling them of your problem, then these people aren't your friends. even i envy my friends. i've deleted my facebook profile and am not in touch with any of my old friends. i think now the envy is less, and its more regret as to even i could've been happy. I feel like I am not worth it, because after a night of meeting her - he decided she is worth of throwing our relationship away. And they also became close real fast, they went on weekends together, they bought each other presents. he even came secretly for a weekend at her town to visit her.. Something he has never done for me and I was always asking for. He said that he wanted to do something rascal, that he never consider her as serious until 5 days ago he said that he remembered the time with her and he doesn't feel good. I don't know what that meant because he got angry and pulled away. He says that he wants to end up with me, that we will work things out (we are not together, we are trying to work things out) but I am so scared that they are secretly communicating and that he will do that again and that I will not take it this time. it sounds like either he loves her or he's doing this to make you feel jealous. i think you need to let him go for yourself. you deserve better. he's being a douche to you. I love him. I don't feel joy in the things I used to, but I feel joy when I am with him. I feel like I am at home. Only sometimes home is haunted by ghosts. its ok if you love him, but you also need to love yourself and stand up for yourself. today if you beg him to come to you, what if tomorrow he repeats the act with some other girl. I still think about ending my life mostly because I don't like who I have become.  I started having nightmares. Honestly I feel like everyone's life would be better off without me. Maybe no one will even notice if I am gone. i dream of passing away in sleep. it really would be peaceful. eventually everyone will move on after a person's death. not sure if everyone's life would be better or worse. it's really not your job to make others lives better while you're alive. Also I am scared that I will push him away with this behavior, because he says I am not the girl he fell in love with.. He is right. I really feel like I am not worth it. i think he's a douche. if someone behaved with your child the way he is behaving with you, what would you say. i used to be like you. i used to be apologetic for standing up for myself. once a bunch of guys bullied me n i had to say sorry for standing up for myself later. i became so submissive that if someone would tell me to wipe their shoes, i may have done that too. i was a beggar of validation. later i realized that true friends dont make each other uncomfortable. friends dont do that. friends dont leave each other in the lurch. now my regret is not standing up for myself sooner. She used to tell everyone that it was love at first sign, that they were soulmates - and I don't know why but I am afraid of this. I am afraid of this being true and I am afraid that he wants to get back together so that he can say that we gave it another try.. Also now I have moved away from my city so the time has come for our plans and that is also why he maybe wants to try again. Because this was our plan. She said that she would even move for him. I feel so stupid for having these thoughts but I am so tired. I just want to be me again. i'm sorry you're going through this. but please dont do anything impulsive like beg him or seduce him. acknowledge the memory and pain and let them pass. it will pass eventually. happily ever after rarely happens in real life. maybe you'll find some other guy. be happy for him and let it go. dont do anything impulsive like i did. you survived for so many years before you met him, you will survive now too. if he's gone then let him go... for your own sake. cherish the good memories maybe. Please don't judge me, I know people have worst problems, but I am so tired. I am begging God everyday to not wake up the next day. I want this to stop. I was always joyful, and brought the energy in the room. Even now people say that I am very positive person and that they can tell me everything and I listen to them and feel as if they are talking about someone else. How can you see me like that? I always wanted to be a surgeon but even the thought of that doesn't make me happy anymore. it really isnt in your job profile to make others happy or be the life of a party/room. this is god complex wherein i feel that i will cheer the other person up. i used to have this. it really is ok to not entertain people. first priority should be yourself and then others. if you dont feel like going to a party then dont go rather than go and later be proud that you sacrificed your selfish mood for a party. my aunt used to do that n it was irritating. please dont think i'm being rude. i'm just being honest that its not anyone responsibility to cheer the other person up. at times an honest conversation is much helpful than a cheerful episode of 'friends' or 'big bang theory' i understand that you dont want to be a surgeon now, but please dont abandon it. pursue the degree and education till the end. cause one day or a month or a year later these emotions will fade but you will have a good degree and career. i have made this mistake but leaving jobs or education midway wont solve anything. it only looks better to quit but it wont help. He says my insecurity and low self esteem are taking away his energy... And that is why I am even more afraid that he is secretly communicating with her because she is more stable I guess.. I just want my head to stop. I want to feel good again, I want to be me again. I don't want to be afraid i think he's being insensitive in not helping you. you need to cut all contact with him. if only we could go back in time... crying helps me at times. take care... its ok to be afraid. its not helpful to wear a mask of courage when in danger.",
      "I have another take on this, just as a possibility. It might be that he is still somewhat immature, and had difficulty with the distance and also with the idea of settling down with you. He might have wanted to see what it would be like with someone else, and has now proved to himself that you are the one for him. He didn't keep the new relationship a secret from you, and he didn't try to see her on the side while he was still going out with you. He broke up with you, tried this new relationship, and now realizes that you are truly the one he wants to spend his life with. I hear the difficulties you're having with what happened, and it seems like it's brought up a lot of childhood trauma. Can you get therapy when you go to your new location? There is a lot that you have to work out on your own, I think, before you can handle returning to a serious relationship with him (if that's what you and he still want). It's better to work that stuff out now since it's causing so much difficulty for you. I'm speaking from experience, although I was the one who couldn't settle down and be committed--I needed to try out other relationships before I realized that the guy I broke up with was really the one for me. He and I have been married now for over 30 years and have 3 children. It seems like you both have issues that need to be worked out, but if you believe he is the right guy for you, then do what you can to work out the issues you have that are interfering with your happiness.",

I felt like I lost the person I was closest too and the person who cared about me the most. I had suicide thoughts, I stopped hanging out with people.. how were you before you met him? i know its difficult but if he doesnt want to be with you, then you have to set him free and even yourself. instead of not hanging out with people, hang out with friends whom you can share your current situation with. i'm not suggesting 'get over it' or 'move on' or 'party/drink' but an honest conversation with a friend has helped me at times. I grow up learning how to take care of myself and I was quite individualistic person. earlier even i used to think that i can take care of myself. in fact i had some pride over myself that i dont need anyone. but now i realize it was shallow. its ok to not ask for help, but its not ok to feel proud over it. cause then we're disrespecting those who ask for help. just as some people are physically strong, some are emotionally strong and some are emotionally weak and that's okay. its ok to ask for help. i'd rather have honest friends with whom i can share my challenge than wear a superman mask and proclaim to never complain in life. I don't recognize myself. I feel like this face is not mine, this hair is not mine so why take care of it. maybe you've changed now. A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions-a quote from google. These toxic thoughts were never something that I had. I was a strong person, I went through a lot in my childhood, and now I am ashamed of myself. I can't stand myself. I feel like I only bother people and that I am boring. I have friends that have happy relationships and I envy them. I feel soooo guilty about that. I love them, I want them to be happy but I envy anyone who has a happy relationship now. reminds myself in 2013. after i had a nervous breakdown i was missing my former self so  much. i still do. i was the person who never whined, i was an achiever in life. what now i realize is that its ok to complain. its ok to be boring. its not your job to entertain others or wear a laughing face all the time. those are only for instagram status that 'be happy. yolo blah blah' if i'm feeling low, i'm going to accept it and not go to a party and dance. if people think you bother them by telling them of your problem, then these people aren't your friends. even i envy my friends. i've deleted my facebook profile and am not in touch with any of my old friends. i think now the envy is less, and its more regret as to even i could've been happy. I feel like I am not worth it, because after a night of meeting her - he decided she is worth of throwing our relationship away. And they also became close real fast, they went on weekends together, they bought each other presents. he even came secretly for a weekend at her town to visit her.. Something he has never done for me and I was always asking for. He said that he wanted to do something rascal, that he never consider her as serious until 5 days ago he said that he remembered the time with her and he doesn't feel good. I don't know what that meant because he got angry and pulled away. He says that he wants to end up with me, that we will work things out (we are not together, we are trying to work things out) but I am so scared that they are secretly communicating and that he will do that again and that I will not take it this time. it sounds like either he loves her or he's doing this to make you feel jealous. i think you need to let him go for yourself. you deserve better. he's being a douche to you. I love him. I don't feel joy in the things I used to, but I feel joy when I am with him. I feel like I am at home. Only sometimes home is haunted by ghosts. its ok if you love him, but you also need to love yourself and stand up for yourself. today if you beg him to come to you, what if tomorrow he repeats the act with some other girl. I still think about ending my life mostly because I don't like who I have become.  I started having nightmares. Honestly I feel like everyone's life would be better off without me. Maybe no one will even notice if I am gone. i dream of passing away in sleep. it really would be peaceful. eventually everyone will move on after a person's death. not sure if everyone's life would be better or worse. it's really not your job to make others lives better while you're alive. Also I am scared that I will push him away with this behavior, because he says I am not the girl he fell in love with.. He is right. I really feel like I am not worth it. i think he's a douche. if someone behaved with your child the way he is behaving with you, what would you say. i used to be like you. i used to be apologetic for standing up for myself. once a bunch of guys bullied me n i had to say sorry for standing up for myself later. i became so submissive that if someone would tell me to wipe their shoes, i may have done that too. i was a beggar of validation. later i realized that true friends dont make each other uncomfortable. friends dont do that. friends dont leave each other in the lurch. now my regret is not standing up for myself sooner. She used to tell everyone that it was love at first sign, that they were soulmates - and I don't know why but I am afraid of this. I am afraid of this being true and I am afraid that he wants to get back together so that he can say that we gave it another try.. Also now I have moved away from my city so the time has come for our plans and that is also why he maybe wants to try again. Because this was our plan. She said that she would even move for him. I feel so stupid for having these thoughts but I am so tired. I just want to be me again. i'm sorry you're going through this. but please dont do anything impulsive like beg him or seduce him. acknowledge the memory and pain and let them pass. it will pass eventually. happily ever after rarely happens in real life. maybe you'll find some other guy. be happy for him and let it go. dont do anything impulsive like i did. you survived for so many years before you met him, you will survive now too. if he's gone then let him go... for your own sake. cherish the good memories maybe. Please don't judge me, I know people have worst problems, but I am so tired. I am begging God everyday to not wake up the next day. I want this to stop. I was always joyful, and brought the energy in the room. Even now people say that I am very positive person and that they can tell me everything and I listen to them and feel as if they are talking about someone else. How can you see me like that? I always wanted to be a surgeon but even the thought of that doesn't make me happy anymore. it really isnt in your job profile to make others happy or be the life of a party/room. this is god complex wherein i feel that i will cheer the other person up. i used to have this. it really is ok to not entertain people. first priority should be yourself and then others. if you dont feel like going to a party then dont go rather than go and later be proud that you sacrificed your selfish mood for a party. my aunt used to do that n it was irritating. please dont think i'm being rude. i'm just being honest that its not anyone responsibility to cheer the other person up. at times an honest conversation is much helpful than a cheerful episode of 'friends' or 'big bang theory' i understand that you dont want to be a surgeon now, but please dont abandon it. pursue the degree and education till the end. cause one day or a month or a year later these emotions will fade but you will have a good degree and career. i have made this mistake but leaving jobs or education midway wont solve anything. it only looks better to quit but it wont help. He says my insecurity and low self esteem are taking away his energy... And that is why I am even more afraid that he is secretly communicating with her because she is more stable I guess.. I just want my head to stop. I want to feel good again, I want to be me again. I don't want to be afraid i think he's being insensitive in not helping you. you need to cut all contact with him. if only we could go back in time... crying helps me at times. take care... its ok to be afraid. its not helpful to wear a mask of courage when in danger. First of all, thank you sooo much for the profound reply! You have no idea how much your wordswere helpful to me. Thank you thank you. I feel glad that the world has people like you and I am glad your friends have you as a friend",

It might be that he is still somewhat immature, and had difficulty with the distance and also with the idea of settling down with you. He might have wanted to see what it would be like with someone else, and has now proved to himself that you are the one for him. He didn't keep the new relationship a secret from you, and he didn't try to see her on the side while he was still going out with you. He broke up with you, tried this new relationship, and now realizes that you are truly the one he wants to spend his life with. I hear the difficulties you're having with what happened, and it seems like it's brought up a lot of childhood trauma. Can you get therapy when you go to your new location?

However I am not glad for the horrible set of friends i had. they bullied me like $#%^ n i took it all in the name of 'friendship' i dont want you to repeat the same mistake. the biggest friendship/relationship one has is with oneself. i lost that because i was: 1) scared of being alone 2) wanted to live in a make-believe world where i have friends i had this illusion like the sitcom 'friends' or 'any random tv show on friendship' n i idealized my colleagues. my therapist asked me to revisit those times and see it from third person. now i realize how wrong i was and how toxic those people were to me. i dont want to cause your break up just for the sake of it, but i just want you to not be in my position where you lose yourself just to be with someone. i think he's treating you the way my friends treated me n if i could go back to the first time my friends treated me badly i'd run away from them rightaway. we all deserve to be treated with respect.",
      "update: We were trying to work things out, right? And yesterday he said that he has been feeling again emotionally dead and doesn't feel anything(especially towards me) and bla bla bla, and wants us to come up with a solution.

He even said ; I will contact you when I get better ;. wtf, why doesn't he chose her already if he wants her so much. I know I know it is irrational but I feel so not good enough. Like he was with me, sleeping next to me, trying to work things out but in the end, he decided that she is better than me and worth it. I wasn't."

      "i have looked into this in the past and also googled it just now and it still doesn't make sense to me or apply to me, but i was wondering what your guys opinion is on the whole research saying that people with depression tend to listen / like listening to sad music for comfort and what not, because if anything, for me, it's the opposite ( based off the \"Research\" i've looked at so far ) the thing is, for one, i haven't really found any topics on this in particular where people gave more personal take on their experiences on this or at least different viewpoints, they all talk about it in a very vague way or one sided, and of course google doesn't really do a good job on giving more specific cases and sources to look into what i'm trying to search. for example, what would be considered sad music, or another one i tried asking is difference between love music and sad music ( in the sense that i like love music, but not another \"sad\" song, yet both can be \"sad\" in nature, depending on the song, etc ) now back to the research part on depression and sad music, the reason why i said i feel opposite to this as someone with depression and schizotypal personality disorder is that the very things they say that make the person feel better or type of \"Sad\" music, happens to be the ones that make me feel dumber,more stupid, more depressed, and i never understood how people with \"Depression\" like it. of course, music taste regardless of whether someone has depression is one thing, but still, doesn't make logical sense. and the music i'm specifically referring to is the ones research says, slower / less intense / non upbeat music, all of which are the types of music i usually dislike and find weak and lousy. so this thread was partly made because i just wanted to express how \"depression\" is not only overdiagnosed but the very definition of it is flawed and inaccurate for a lot of resources, even the criteria is too low for diagnosing, two weeks only? why not change it to 2 months, that's far more reasonable, although i've mentioned this many times elsewhere and provided details, but with this said, it would make sense why they'd confuse sadness as depression and those listening to these \"sad\" music aren't actually clinically depressed but rather \"sad\" which is different from clinical depression, besides the fact that other research has shown that those who actually have clinical depression are not really \"Sad\" per say, but actually flat in how they feel, in other words, life is dull, and not dull as in they're too good for it or something like the examples they give on ADHD / bipolar people being bored because they aren't challenged enough or something, but dull / flat as in a coping mechanism to distress and life being stressful and challenging, lacking reward because the person is inferior / unfavorable upbringing / living circumstances past present, not given adequate support, resources, etc. anyways, i didn't want to over elaborate on other things, but i did want to hear what opinion you guys have on this / your take on all this. also for reference, i have a link below on one research in particular, which was not bad in that it included subset of information for better conclusion making, but without proper critical judgement, it's just raw information. i wanted to go over this, because for the portion it mentioned more complex music, i related to that, but not for \"Sad\" music it seems. the study wasn't about depression, but rather on sad music. though, the findings are exactly what my points are trying to bring out, that those who like \"sad\" music, again, i put in quotes because there hasn't been any clear definition of what it is, and / or other types of music, subjectivity making it even more complicated, such as what would be considered \"melancholic\" music, but if i wanna be objective here, that of majority of those who like \"sad\" music are not those with clinical depression, and when i say this, i'm also talking about those type of people who may even be diagnosed with \"Depression\" professionally and be the type of person who likes to go alone in a dark room and watch a scary movie... https://www.researchgate.net/publicatio ... ic_and_Why",
      "Sentimentalism and all other forms of emotional appeal sells better than anything else. Especially sadness and self-pity. I believe there's an evolutionary reason as to why people focus on and respond more to discontent rather than contentedness, but I can't remember why at the moment. People who have more to lose (as well as people who are highly intelligent and those for whom the gluttony of self pity and sorrow does nothing) are less likely to try to wallow in it. user03 wrote: type of people who may even be diagnosed with \"Depression\" professionally and be the type of person who likes to go alone in a dark room and watch a scary movie... I'm not sure what opinion you've placed on this bit, but it's not an unreasonable form of emotional regulation - it can actually be an effective technique for some.",
      "I definitely prefer listening to \"sad\" music when I'm depressed. If I hear upbeat stuff I feel like saying STFU. It's hard to believe in that crap when you're depressed. Sad music is comforting. Maybe it lets you more easily think about your feelings and gives a sort of release.",
      "I think there was a deep relationship between sad songs and depression. I also like to listen to sad music at the time of depression.",
      "Sometimes we have to know sadness in order to experience joy. Without one perspective, the other would not exist. I can take mournful, melancholy minor chords in music. It helps me feel emotions, remember and reprocess past despair. I can't take country music about drinking and broken hearts. Perhaps it hits too close to my past and who I was? My wife loves country music.",

      "I’m not sure where to post this, but this seems to be as good a place as any. I’m turning 43 next month, and that makes it 30 years that I have felt hurt, angry, but most of all tired, so, so tired. I know that most of the pain and fatigue is caused by childhood abuse, and started EMDR therapy last year. The problem is that I’m autistic, and have a photographic memory. For most people, the effects of EMDR radiate out towards other traumatic memories, but in my case, they don’t. The one thing the therapy has given me is this dreadful certainty; I can’t spend eternity in therapy, and I can’t live another 30 years like this. Waking up every day, and igniting in rage, or collapsing with grief within 20 minutes, unable to cry, trapped in myself, never really connecting with anyone because I’m just… blocked. I’m certainly considering asking what my options for euthanasia are at this point, but I’m afraid there aren’t any for someone my age with no physical ailments. I don’t want to leave my family and friends, but I can’t go on, the pain just won’t come out. Anyone who has struggled with this, how do I let go of the pain?",
      "You're describing a very a complex situation. I hope you also posted something like this in the ASD, AS, (if applicable, one of the abuse) and PTSD subforums so that it gets visibility, and hopefully, some feedback.",
      "Training the mind to unlearn and rewrite the past is a huge undertaking. If EMDR doesn't seem to be effective, I would pursue other possible options with your doctor and therapist. I hope that you find an answer, maybe redoing the beginning of the new day when this trauma all begins again. Best of luck to you."

      "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years now, I was aware of his depression very early on and we have been battling it together. I have had my own issues with depression and mainly anxiety. To give a little bit of back story: My boyfriend was diagnosed with clinical depression at around 8 years of age and has seen different therapists over the years. At his lowest point, just over a year ago his workplace stress and depression had gotten so bad that he lost so much weight and had been hospitalized a few times, eventually having to leave his job to heal and gain weight back. (We don’t have much support from either of our families and we both accept that.) His depression is severe enough that even when the smallest inconvenience arises he will burst out in extreme anger, have a panic attack or sometimes episodes of vasovagal syncope. Fast forward a few months of healing, trying different antidepressants, anxiety medications, and therapists all which seemed to discourage him a little more because none of them had any noticeably positive effects regardless of how badly he wanted them to help. Once he gained some weight back he got a new job and was more positive for a little bit but the ‘honeymoon phase’ of his job ended and he is back to his looping thoughts that he will be stuck in this job forever and will have to work until the day he dies. Every single morning is a struggle trying to encourage him to get through the work day, I remind him how good he feels with he gets his paycheck and that he’s working toward a better job and life. I’ve even told him if he wants to change careers that I fully support him and that it’s not a setback, just a change but he sees life as time sensitive and everyday he’s not working towards a higher level job, he’s just falling behind. He is back to a very dark place again and it’s almost daily now that he gets upset and repeats over and over -out loud- how much he wants to die, he wishes I would let him die, he begs God to find a way to kill him so he doesn’t have to do it himself. I try my best to be strong and supportive but it’s hard not to get upset at the thought of losing your life partner especially when you know one day they could act on it. We’ve had the conversational about an in-patient facility where they can give him full attention and work through everything over the course of a few days but I understand that it might seem shameful or daunting and he says he would rather die that do that a single day in his life. He is currently taking a break from seeking treatment and therapy due to the negative history of none of them improving his mindset or mood and the medical debt he is still getting through. I struggling finding the right things to say to him when he is struggling, he’s even told me I used to help him fight his depression but that I don’t anymore. It seems like anytime I encourage him or make a suggestion he just gets agitated. I want to support him and help him and I try not to take anything he says personally when he is depressed but it’s HARD. I’ve even made appointments for him and driven with him to them. I have pretty bad anxiety, I’m sure it’s gotten worse over the years of family and life stress, always being in this supportive role for someone else. I am typically uncomfortable in any public place or anytime we are socializing with someone that I’m not already VERY familiar with. I’ve had to overcome a lot of this on my own due to his mental health issues (some things as small as working up the courage to make a phone call to make an appointment for him, which I could never do beforehand). Along with my anxiety I’m fairly introverted and time to recharge at home away from social interaction is crucial for me, if not emotions and mental struggles will just build and lead to a mental breakdown or ‘anxiety attacks’. This has become another hurdle because with his depression time outside of the house or socializing with friends is a perfect distraction for him and I understand that but he wants/expects me to go with his every single time because I’m the only person who he trusts enough and can help him if he has an episode or passes out. I’ve explained to him that I need time to recharge and it’s okay if he goes without me but he gets angry at the suggestion of it. He is very patient and caring if I get to the point of a breakdown but doesn’t quite understand that I need to do certain things to help prevent them from happening regardless of how I try to explain it. overall I need help, I haven’t given up on him in 6 years and I have no intention of giving up on him now, even when he is doubting my love and support. Everything I’ve read just says keep trying but I don’t know how to keep trying without repeating the same things I’ve already said or things we’ve tried to do. I’ve suggested a healthy diet and going on hikes or walks outside, meditation, different types of therapy, but all those things are minuscule compared to this monster of depression, and some of them he isn’t willing to try. I know we haven’t exhausted all of our resources, but I’m exhausted and desperate and need to know what is left to do that may help him. I’m not willing to lose my best friend. so.... 1. What are things I can say to him when he is at a low that won’t make the situation worse or make him agitated? Specifically when he is repeating how much he wants to die. 2. How can I encourage him to seek different therapy/psychiatry without pressure or bringing on the stress of his medical debt or the doubt of previously unhelpful dr’s and counselors? 3. He is always more willing to try home remedies, are there any things he can try to do at home other than going on walks or meditation? 4. Is there a better way for me to explain that I need my self care time to recharge away from social situations so in-turn I can better support him and be more present? Any and All suggestions are appreciated, thank you in advance!!",
      "There can be very fine lines between - supporting someone - caregiving - enabling It may be helpful for you to seek support for yourself and guidance on how to place more responsibility back onto him. There's also a term called \"caregiver burnout\" or \"caregiver fatigue\" that you may want to look up --- and on how to live with a chronically ill significant other. Unfortunately, there are no magic wands and there are no instant results. Progress and recovery, for most mental illnesses it seems, comes from a synergy of many small changes and actions rather than one easy-to-follow, one-size-fits-all, concrete path. More likely, coming out of his depression will be non-linear and gradual. Perhaps, so much so, that you two don't even notice until he's \"better\""

      "I'm self employed and I've read so many articles & have been given advice about loneliness by so many \"experts\" over the years, and they all say things like: - join a club - spend time with friends - make friends at the gym - go out and chat to people - call family - host a dinner party - talk to neighbours - make online friends ... but none of these \"experts\" seems to realise that if any of the above were an option, the person likely wouldn't be lonely in the first place! It's infuriating. I'm self employed and I'm naturally a person with decent people skills, I'm sociable almost anyone would assume I have friends. After I became self employed, all my friends left the area. I lived in an area where people were of a certain \"type\" and were closed minded to anyone not of that same type. No matter how friendly I was to anyone, they were dismissive of me. It was impossible to make friends- our education & backgrounds were so completely different.. not to mention class. It seems that class segregation is a huge problem in many parts of the UK. Even if you don't conform to a \"class\" in the traditional sense- many people will assume you do & not want to know you or even talk to you. I became so suicidally depressed & so so so lonely. I would literally go for weeks or months without contact with even a soul. I absolutely loved my home - it was a dream home but the area & people were so friendly toward each other but isolating and aggressive toward me that I ended up selling my beloved home & moving after years of misery & failed attempts at therapy /CBT etc. Then I moved to an area with better transport links where I was \"perceived\" as the same \"class\" / \"background\" as the locals- and everything changed! My home wasn't ideal but suddenly I was respected & treated me like an equal. I was able to make friends & able to do things because of the transport links. My point here is that the advice people give on loneliness is so often inflexible & presumptuous, and doesn't recognise the fact that depression, loneliness, and other mental illnesses / problems aren't always possible to change *internally* and sometimes require external changes, such as moving area. I'm going to go through the above and point out how ridiculous they are in many situations: - join a club This isn't 1970 where hobby clubs existed around every corner- even in a big city, it's nigh-on impossible to find a suitable \"club\" especially if your interests aren't mainstream. In fact, outside university I've never heard of or seen any club, or met anyone who goes to one. Even decades ago in university, no one I knew went to a club, and no one knew of any. -go to the library Going to the local library from my experience never helps, and only makes you feel even worse because these days they're not full of the type of people I get along with (good people skills, sociable, young at heart)- in fact, the only age I ever saw in the local libraries in today's day and age was 60+ or children. - spend time with friends Most people who suffer loneliness don't have friends!!!!! That's the point ! Infuriating suggestion. - make friends at the gym I have tried making friends at the gym in many different parts of the UK, but people *never* want to chat- they all want to get on with their workout and leave, and I don't blame them. In fact, if you try to talk to people, they'll actively avoid you. If your experience is different to this, then perhaps you're in a different area- not all areas are the same. - go out and chat to people Even in the friendliest areas, out of the thousands of times I've chatted to strangers outside, 0 times has it ended up in friendship- it's extremely rare, and so rare in fact that it is silly to even suggest it as a friend making idea. However, most lonely people don't live in a \"friendly\" area, hence the reason why they're lonely! When I went outside to chat with people, I got chased down the street, almost beaten up, and at best- people would ignore me & walk off. Where I live at the moment, I'm surrounded by anti-social people who do not like talking to each other. If I try and talk with them, they get extremely irritated. It all depends on the area. When I lived in a \"friendly\" area, I could talk to people- but the locals were a different age group to me and they never ended up as friends and I never saw them again, no matter how often I went out. - call family Many lonely people don't have family- that's why they're lonely! If they did, they wouldn't need someone to tell them to \"call family\"- they'd have thought of it themselves already! Ridiculous suggestion. - host a dinner party See above.. people who are lonely don't have friends & therefore any dinner party they host is going to be attended by imaginary friends. - talk to neighbours Not all neighbours are the type you see on the australian soap opera \"neighbours\" where you can say hi & strike up a conversation. Where I used to live, neighbours wouldn't even acknowledge my existance & if I said \"hi\" they'd actively avoid me... if I tried to force friendliness onto them, they'd get visibly angry and run back inside their housees. Currently where I live, my neighbours are aggressive. The first time I moved in, my neighbour on the right knocked on my door- I thought to welcome me to the area- but it was to shout and swear at me because some dust came out of my front door and onto his car. He's the type who swears in every other sentence. Any attempt I make to be friendly with him seems to fail- and I don't enjoy the whole swearing every other word thing. The neighbours on the left either ignore me when I say hi, grimace and look angrily at me, or, if I keep trying to talk to them, they'll get angry. The people where I live right now are extremely anti-social, and any attempts at being friendly with them just backfires- you end up with loads of letters through your door asking you to pay builders to modify your house or garden walls because they don't like how it \"looks\".. which when you have no money, is impossible. - make online friends if online friends staved off loneliness then no one would ever be lonely. We are social animals & can't survive without human contact. - find lodgers Only who have ever actually tried interviewing or having lodgers in this area seem to understand that once you have them, all you want is to be alone again. They are aggressive & just as anti-social as the locals. I've spoken to a lot of people who suffered loneliness and in many cases the only way they solved it was by moving. My point is, at least from my experience, loneliness can't always be solved internally- sometimes it's external factors that are out of your control, and only until you're in a position to move area will things improve. The above ideas so many experts have, only show the fact they themselves have never truly experienced extreme loneliness themselves.",
      "Apologies for the grammatical errors above, struggled to re-read it as I've not had much sleep! The point I was trying to make was that loneliness isn't an internal factor in my life- it can be correlated directly with location in the UK, transport links & the culture of locals in that location. I tried moving areas a few times & it didn't work -- I was still lonely-- until I moved to a decent area with friendly types & good transport. I can also directly correlate my depression, headaches & health with the area I live. There are a lot of depressive areas in the UK. The funny part is that when you're depressed, people try to give you advice.. but when you're happy they ask for advice. The irony is you're still the same person - the only difference is your life circumstances. (unless you're depressed because of internal factors) I was depressed for decades, constantly moving around searching for somewhere I could be happy. I've always been targeted by thugs or excluded by people. My depression lasted so long that people assumed it was something wrong with me. However, I then moved to an area where I was suddenly so happy because it was safe & the locals accepted me for who I am.. they were educated, buildings were pretty & there were loads of resources (swimming pool etc) and great transport links nearby. Within a few months, people saw the changes in me and would say things like \"wow you look so different! what happened? You look like a different person! Your face shape and body has changed.\".. I would reply \"I live somewhere I'm happy.\". I don't understand why it's so hard for people to believe it. At that time, they suddenly started asking my advice about their lives.. as if I had all the answers. My life circumstances changed and I had to move again- now I'm in an area that makes me so thoroughly depressed. Once again, everyone started offering me advice. It's ironic. They don't realise that so much of life is down to luck, and just because you're happy / depressed, doesn't necessarily mean you manufactured it yourself. I'm now stuck here for reasons I won't go into. I've spent the last 2 years trying to either make a good life for myself here or to escape- neither is working & I know exactly why. It's a dump. The friends I made in other areas don't even want to visit me here because it takes so long to get to & is too boring, noisy & depressing when you're here. There's nothing to do and no peace or quiet & local people are unfriendly & aggressive. But I know it's nothing wrong with me- it's the unfriendly people, the loud road noise, lack of transport & resources. Human beings have basic needs in life and if where you live doesn't meet those needs you will be depressed- it doesn't matter who you are. I hope one day I can escape this dump and get back to living somewhere decent where I won't be depressed anymore.",
      "I have been very lonely at times and it has made me do things which are not healthy sometimes, for example talking to unsavoury characters. Though I find now that a way to help with the feelings like that is to enjoy being at home, for example cooking food you like and enjoying it, then if someone else talks to you, you can invite them to enjoy the food you like. Though obviously I am still not a social wizz.",
      "If you can strike a semi friendship with one person you can then meet other people through them and branch out to being able to meet more people.  Easier said than done, but that's how my social circle grew."

      "I’ve only been taking antidepressants for 1 year but I still haven’t found what worked for me. I’m currently on lamictal and cymbalta (on cymbalta for 6 weeks and lamictal for 5 days) and I’m really hoping that this will help me. I’ve been on at least 15-20 different meds the past year and I was doing well on one but I had side effects and I had to be taken off of it. And has anyone ever thrown up after latuda because when I was on it I’d throw up multiple times a week? Anyway has anyone had luck on these meds? Because my old psych told me that it’s my attitude that’s the issue but really that’s not the case because I’m trying to stay positive but I recently switched psychs. Hoping for the best",
      "Hold on tight to that hope. I know that some meds helped to 'take the edge off' my depression and anxiety. Sometimes the anxiety would build into panic. It felt like I couldn't breathe and at times, felt like I was having a heart attack. There was no fast-acting or miracle med. The chemistry takes time to build-up and change patterns. I was on old-school Imipramine and Buspar. Behavior change was helped by 12-step recovery meetings. It took years of therapy for recovery, but it did get better. A lot better from where I started. Being told that it is 'attitude' is very unprofessional. I'm glad that you have moved on to another psych. It helped me to find one that went through similar issues as I did. There are alternatives, like ECT, etc if meds don't help. Best of luck to you.",

      "I would like to know what I can do to (at least mentally) get out of this situation? I am depressed because of my living, financial, and social situations. I don't really have a way to deal with this so I work until I am blue in the face, worry about my finances until I know where every dollar has gone, and stay away from fun social situations with other people. This leads me to have a incredibly bleak life style. All work and no play make me a dull person. How can I get out and have some fun in cheap ways with other people so I don't spend my weekends sleeping and my weekdays working until the sun goes down? Thanks"

      "I recently got involved in a new relationship with an amazing, caring, loving woman. She has major depressive disorder and is 32 years old and lives with her parents and is on disability for it. She works occasionally part time when she can and is often busy around the house. While this is all new for me, I didn't want to give up on her because I understand battling demons in the mind as I too have my own struggles with anxiety. She has been through the ringer since she was a child. Every medicine you can imagine, she's been on. Numerous electro shock therapy sessions, etc. When I am with her she seems happy and engaged for the most part and we enjoy each others company. Active sex life. We joke and laugh together. I have noticed some behaviors and I guess I just wanted to hear from other who have this depression as well to see if it is normal. Sometimes it looks like laziness and I don't like having those thoughts about her in my head because I do care about her so much. There will be occasional days sporadically where she is just completely out of commission. Not a text or a call or a peep. This normally only lasts for 24 hours which I can live with, but I'm just trying to understand it. How she can be so fine and normal and happy one day and then the very next day can't even leave her bedroom to use the bathroom or make some food. (Her parents and I have gotten very close and this is what they tell me.) Also, when she is doing well we have deep talks about it and she tells me things like \"I just stare off into space for hours and hours and hours and forget to even eat or pee\" or \"it feels like you're a lion in a cage pacing back and forth and you can't get out\". I've noticed other behaviors too like if she has a big family trip planned or a big out of town event or something she will be all packed and ready to walk out the door but instead she will just curl up and back out last minute then isolate in her room again. There is so much more to this and I believe I am handling it all as lovingly as I can. I don't take it personally at all either. I suppose I'm just trying to understand it and see if anyone can relate to this behaviors. I understand every brain is uniquely different, but any insight in helping an outsider understand would be so wonderful! I hate that the depression looks like laziness... because than I battle in my brain ..\"is it real? what's going on here.\" and I have those thoughts etc. Thank you kindly. ''t",
      "Hey VoodoChild, We aren't doctors or professionals, so all you'll get is guesses and opinions here. A question first though - Since it is not clear to you what is depression versus 'laziness', it is not clear to me either.   Related, what do you perceive as lazy vs say she just needs down time to recharge her emotional batteries?",
      "Xdude, I like what you're saying about charging the emotional batteries. That makes sense to me. I would consider laziness to look like laying around in bed all day, not cleaning or showering. Her depression also sometimes looks like this. That's why as an outsider who doesn't suffer with depression it can be hard to see it as depression. Does that make sense?",
      "“The madness of depression is, generally speaking, the antithesis of violence. It is a storm indeed, but a storm of murk. Soon evident are the slowed-down responses, near paralysis, psychic energy throttled back close to zero. Ultimately, the body is affected and feels sapped, drained.”- William Styron I've suffered major depression twice in my life and when I read Styron's \"Darkness Visible\", I related very much to what he described in his memoir of what his depression was like.  He was a famous author who wrote \"Sophie's Choice\" and other novels.  Perhaps his descriptive memoir can help you gain some understanding of this mental illness.  Your public library may have the book.",

      "Anyone found their depression being worsened by the state of the world/society this year? I've been speaking to a few people who have, like me, found 2019 pretty unbearable for a myriad of reasons. But I wondered how much the social and political landscape has affected everyone or exacerbated symptoms, if at all?",
      "Well I'm pretty much blackpilled, but then I was depressed, anyway.  Doesn't help, though.  Just deepens my sense of disaster. Just a modly reminder that I think we can discuss this purely as it relates to our mental health, but in generalised terms- politics as a subject in and of itself is prohibited on PF- however this mod does recognise that as things disintegrate the effects of the wider world on our state of mind will become more difficult to parse.  Still, just a reminder not to engage in direct political discussion, thanks."

      "Too often, I read and listen to stories of rich famous people who are depressed. I even know several people who claim they are depressed. My question is ... do people choose to be depressed? For example: * My cousin - She has a beautiful 3-story home. She is pretty, and she is in awesome physical shape. Her husband makes lots of money. She spends all day pampering herself. She has a chef, maid, and personal driver. Life couldn't be better. But recently, she checked herself into a mental hospital. She was diagnosed with depression. I'm like ... she lives the perfect life. How can she possibly be depressed? * My friend - He is 28 years old. He has no kids. He dates the hottest guys and girls. He lives a very tranquil life filled with happy, loving, supportive family and friends. Yet he attempted suicide earlier this year. I know several people with these lovely lives ... and at the end of the day they're depressed. How can someone live in such luxury .. and still be depressed? I wish I could go to my cousin and say I'm so sorry for what you're going through ... but your luxurious home, wealthy husband, and personal assistants weren't enough for you???",
      "Sometimes we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. We don't know what dwells underneath, nor would we want to, most likely. A next-door neighbor Rabbi once explained to me that if we could put all of our problems in a clear plastic bag for all to see, we then hung our bags on the branches of a tree and we had the choice of any bag that we wanted, the chances are that we would want our old problems back. While someone may look like they have it all, the insides may be in turmoil. Some people can't cry or blow off stress and really need to. Depression can be anger and hopelessness turned inward. It can be deadly. Many epitaphs could be written to say \"that he always kept to himself\" or \"he seemed like the nicest guy\". It is sad that we generally can't recognize or choose not to acknowledge the pain inside.",
      "How old are you, OP? Most people have to rack up a certain amount of experiences before they realize how the human mind works.",
      "I think some people find that being ill (physically or otherwise) is a good way to attract attention and to get others to feel sorry for them. I've also found that external circumstances have nothing to do with depression.",
      "Definitely not, I wish that was true then I could return back to normal.",
      "(Note: I write from a substance monist philosophical position; a substance dualist might describe things somewhat differently) First things first: Depression and sadness are not the same thing.  Most presentations of depression do not exclude the possibility of happiness at times.  A person who seems happy, upbeat, jovial, or other pro-social presentations can still be depressed.  It is better to think of depression as a flaw in normative brain functioning. Remember that the mind is a consequence of the functioning of the brain (more precisely, it IS the functioning of the brain).  That functioning depends on certain balances of certain chemicals -- not only the neurotransmitters, but also essential nutrients for cellular functioning, energetic nutrients for cellular metabolism.  As well, that functioning depends on the structures of the brain -- subtle differences in formation of those structures can have significant impact on the functioning of the brain, and thus of the mind that arises from it. The externals of a person's life, those things you can see, observe, and describe, don't necessarily correspond in obvious ways to the internals of a person's life. You may see your friends and family as having monetary success, familial success, or other markers of quality of life.  However, you have no ability to see whether their serotonin or dopamine production is normal (low levels of either are known to correlate with depression), unless you're a trained neurologist with biopsies of their brain tissue.  You've no ability, unless you are a trained radiologist with fMRI access and these people in that fMRI, to observe the structural and functional organization of their brain. Your lack of knowledge about their internal state means you cannot know what is going on in their head.  Depression need not fully hamper a person's ability to function -- it certainly can, but for many people, they are able to 'go through the motions' as it were, acquiring certifications/training for building a career, maintaining a career, making social bonds, managing their life.  This is because the defects leading to depression need not impair aspects of the mind known as 'executive function'.  Executive function include abilities like planning, prioritizing, keeping on task, predicting outcomes, etc.  While social skills typically depend on a number of aspects of the mood regulation pathways, where these are deficient, people can often navigate social scenarios via critical reasoning and logical analysis. For some people, depression is linked to events that others can see and observe.  Where this grief process takes an extended period, there can be diagnosis of certain types of depression.  Treatment for event-based depression often takes the form of a course of anti-depressants to help the person return to normal functioning quickly, with therapy to process through the grief.  The goal in such case is to eventually ween the person off the anti-depressants and return them to normal-for-them functioning. People who have a problem with brain function often have life-long depression.  There are known genetic variants that cause dopamine and or serotonin production to be significantly below that which is normative, for example.  There are known brain structure defects that correlate strongly with depression.  These things are present at birth and (with current medical approaches) cannot be corrected -- they can't be cured.  Treatment in such a case usually involves maintenance dosing of anti-depressants for the rest of the person's life, along with on-going, life-long therapy to help a person navigate their mood dysregulation.  A major problem doctors face with such cases is that it can often take many attempts to find just the right medication -- or even multiple medications -- to help the person treat their depression... and worse, in the process of trying to find the right 'recipe', some of the prescriptions tried can make things worse. There are some skills that can be learned that help as well -- many people with depression either independently 'invent' or get formal training in 'mindfulness', which is a technique where one practices being aware of one's patterns of thinking, being able to identify when maladaptive thinking is happening, and using various techniques to distract from that form of thinking or willfully pointing one's thoughts in a more positive direction.  This technique can be helpful in resolving event-based depression, but can only be therapeutic for those with life-long defects -- that is, it can help, but it can't remove the underlying cause. The big take away is this -- you can't know the functioning of their brain, and depression can be functional instead of psychological in origin.  As such, markers of quality of life such as a vibrant social life, a successful career, wealth, etc, cannot be used to determine if a person is not depressed, nor can absence of those markers be used to determine if a person is depressed.",
      "I could be similar to your cousin.  I have suffered from depression off and on since I was 16 years old.  I'm 44 now.  I finally got diagnosed with bipolar disorder Type I.  For others it could be a chemical imbalance.  Childhood neglect or abuse they are dealing with but have no help.  A huge number of things that they went through or are going through.  It is true that my friends point out the positive in my life, but inside me I was dead to the world.  I said, if someone gave me $1000 I couldn't feel happy.  Because I was depressed.  Depression can lead to psychosis, to wanting to take your own life, to seeking help and checking oneself into a mental hospital, or for me it was going to the ER and they later sent me to a facility where I was on suicide watch.  It can lead to other things like not being able to enjoy each day. It is hard to make the idea that you're depressed for no reason at all a real truth.  But for me, I can attest to that, it's real.  I understand how you think OP, my friends all see things like you do, but I found such shame in admitting I was so sad, so down.  For no reason whatsoever.  Or for reasons that were private. So, my answer to your question is no people do not choose to be depressed in the true sense of the word.  I'm well.  But I empathize well with others who go through depression.  One nurse asked me when I was in a mental hospital after I had tried to take my life, if I had marital problems, money problems and other things.  He concluded that I had absolutely no reason to be depressed.  Before I left the facility, they apologized to me.  But see, even a health professional can think that way."

      "I'm having a really bad time of it these past few weeks. Bad anxiety, feelings of hopelessness and dread, depression. I just want to sleep all day so I don't have to think of these things. But it's there when I wake up. I've been having some passive suicidal thoughts these past few weeks too. Besides the anxiety, I feel like I've somewhat become a different person since my OCD manifested 3-4 years ago (or I became more aware of it). I feel like I am in a constant state of anxiety and depression. I've alway been a bit of a depressive person, linked to my low self-esteem. Over the years I've made some strides in bettering myself, but I feel like I've lost all of that. As I've been more anxious/depressive, I feel like I've also become more envious, irritable, and short fused. I'm a bit of a sounding board for my families and friends problems, and there are some days when I just want to scream that I just can't do it. I can't keep listening to their problems, it gives me so much anxiety. But I continue out of guilt/obligation, which makes me feel horrible. I WANT to want to listen to them. I want to be empathetic, but there are times where a family member could be talking to me, crying, and and while cognitively I'm concerned, I feel almost nothing but the all-consuming anxiety of OCD. Constantly checking my own emotions, wondering why I'm not crying along with them, wondering what's wrong with me. I've been having anxiety that I am a narcissist again lately, and these events don't help. I feel like the anxiety and constant checking cut off any emotions I may feel at the time, so they're really just a feeling that then gets choked away when my brain says \"did you REALLY feel that? Was that real? For attention?\" and I spiral. I have had the same problems when I was worried about having schizoid personality disorder, ASPD, worried about being asexual, etc. Even when I DO feel an emotion around something, such as being happy for a friend getting a job that he enjoys, my mind will almost immediately trick me into thinking that that emotion was fake. There are also times where I feel like I don't really KNOW someone. Like they will be talking to me, and I'm listening and talking back, but it feels like there's not really anything there. Like they're not, idk real? Or I'm not? Like clearly I know they are, but it's just a really weird feeling that, of course, also feeds into the narcissism/personality disorder OCD. That stopped for a while, but has come back since my OCD has gotten really bad. I guess it's due to the internal thoughts that are happening during my conversations (do you really like this person? Are you annoying them? Do you feel anything?), and so I can't really pay attention to them? Maybe this is dissociation? Idk. I'm so tired. I feel like I don't know myself.",

I am trying to get him to see our in-house mental health counselor who has already been briefed on some of his background and since they work in the same agency knows he is getting treated for SUD. Additionally, although we do have a Psych ARNP on site I am only trying to get him to see the counselor as I think he needs more counseling and guidance than meds. Thank you again. I just want to do the best I can for him. If you know of any more professional based forums please let me know.",
      "I can't think of one offhand.  Our direct competitors are also peer-support.  I see a lot of clickbait out there when doing a search for professional forums, you'll have some weeding to do. In-house didn't occur to me- that would be ideal, wouldn't it?  if they could be convinced to do so.  If they have internet, possible at least have them look thru here or one of the other peer forums- I can think of one specifically for depression, that I used to visit a little.  Maybe at least reading others' stories and experiences with getting help might spur them to get the counseling they need in that area.  Maybe they could talk to one of the other clients there who see someone for depression?  I don't know, just throwing out ideas."

      "Hi everyone, I have been using Zoloft (actually generic equivalent) for about a decade now. Started with 25 mg. Now I am taking 150 mg. It has not completely stopped working, but due to my husband's mental illness - which you can find in my other posts - I seem to find myself depressed and crying a lot. What meds have you tried for depression? What side effects did you have? What was you experience. Thanks.",
      "I started Sertraline about a year ago to quiet the music in my head, stop the ruminating and help me sleep better. I am currently on 75 mg. It takes the edge off and I could go to 150 mg if I asked the doctor. I was on anti-depressant/anti-anxiety meds about 28 years ago. This was the old-school Imipramine and Buspar. These proven meds had been around a long time and were in mild doses. I had housemates that were on Prozac. There are so many choices out there now, that it makes Prozac look old. Really the older meds still help some people that can't tolerate certain classes of drugs. ECT helps those that can't tolerate any meds. Nothing wrong with that. You have to differentiate how much of the depression is 'situational' and how much is biological. My only side effect really was dry-mouth. My body did adjust after a year or so and I always had my ice water with me. It got better. Best of luck to you.",
      "Thank you. It's hard to differentiate situation induced from biological after 17 years of \"situation.\" But I understand what you are saying. Thanks again for your reply."

      "Been in therapy for trauma issues for a long time. Always optimistic with a can do let's work this out attitude. Altho had bouts of what T called depression, came out of it & moved on.  After a serious revelation, the bottom just dropped out. I just don't care..about anything. Ridiculous that I know I don't care, should, but I don't care. My T doesn't do meds if there is anyway to avoid it. Hospital for safety issues or at my request. Not stupid. Know what not to say. Rationally, know eventually something has to change. Looking for experienced advise. Is this something I can just wait out?",
      "There is such a thing as therapy burnout, when you run out of things to talk about or it is time to move to the next level. There is apathy when we are numb to the world around us. That is a warning sign to me when I don't care anymore. It is a return to isolation and rigid thinking that got me in trouble in the first place. Maybe meds in low-dosage could take the edge off? Would you be adverse to trying that? Many times therapy in conjunction with a mild anti-depressant/anti-anxiety med can help. Best of luck to you.",

      "Hi, I used to be a highly sensitive person and now I would classify myself as \"anhedonic\". I don't really have highs or that many lows anymore. It's like I've flatlined. Before I use to feel connected to everyone around me and now I can't feel it anymore. For instance, I can't read my emotions when I am about to say something to \"judge\" what the reaction will be. It's like I've lost my sixth sense and now life is difficult because I have to rely on my logic skills. When I was younger I loved to make people laugh. I remember I would adapt myself to the individual to find ways to make them laugh as much as possible, but now my sense of humour is virtually non-existent. I don't joke around very much because I can't tell if what I'm saying is funny. Sometimes I try to do it and I just end up insulting someone.

      "Made a list of pros & cons of being a cashier in retail hell & was surprised to see both columns almost equal, but of course the cons are winning. At least I’m no longer in denial that working retail again would be the worst. I’ve shot myself in the foot before being positive about it, only to go down in proverbial flames.

Can you get up at the time you need to with an alarm? Can you brush your teeth and shower regularly enough? Can you prepare food for yourself three times a day? Can you handle going outside and being around strangers? Can you do what you need to do in a day without burning out / being exhausted by it, to the point where it's impacted your ability to cope? Could you do more with your day than you're currently doing and handle it consistently on a day-to-day basis? I find whenever I'm unsure if I could go back to work / uni or not that going through those questions helps. Right now I can barely function in my day-to-day life, even while doing nothing besides therapy once a week, and I know I can't work because of that fact.

      "The position I've put myself in is setting up tumultuous times in my near future. My life is beginning to collapse under the weight of all my lies to others. My relationships are strained. No one trusts me or takes me seriously. I'm unable to find a job, and my lack of social contacts makes that situation much more difficult. Honestly, I've accepted my fate and am ready to have my life as it currently is shaken up. This fate is the culmination of everything I am. Maybe it will set in a new era in my life. The state of hitting rock bottom will force me to alter course. I'm kind of excited for my life to be in ruins so I can start anew. Have any of you guys gone through a similar rebirth process? Also, sorry if it's not apparent to you how this relates to depression, these circumstances reinforce my depression",

      "I'd like to run this situation by some people with experience. I recently visited a psychiatrist. The visit was strange in a couple of ways. I waited for almost an hour and 15 mn and was the last patient of the day (new patients on Wednesdays only). I was given a series of questionnaires to fill out which were thorough and useful. I was also given a medical intake which was thorough and helpful. Then, though, when I finally got to see the psychiatrist it was very underwhelming. There were two other med students in the room. She asked me some very superficial questions, glanced at the questionnaires and basically asked me if I wanted medication almost right aways. I told her that I would rely on her professional advice if she thought it absolutely necessary. She proceeded to ask a few more questions about moods, but the questions seemed very superficial and as if she was not concerned about a thorough diagnosis. Then there was even some light talk about my work and where I came from, to kind of lighten the mood. She then prescribed Lamotrigine, 25mg. To be clear I knew before hand that I had anxiety and depression, both my previous psychologists and psychiatrist had determined that, as well as the MD that referred me to this psych, so there was context, but still, there was something superficial about the experience. I am highly skeptical about whether this was a thorough psych evaluation and wonder whether I should get a second opinion before getting on what looks like a powerful med. Any opinions would be helpful. Thank you,",
      "that sounds awful!. I have bipolar disorder and am on lamotrigine as a mood stabiliser, but it shouldnt be used as a first line treatment in depression or anxiety! antidepressants should be used first and then if really bad and they dont work, possibly lithium I work in psychiatry at the moment and you do questionnaires - one for depression and one for anxiety and they give you a 'diagnosis' or whether you have mild/mod/severe depression or anxiety. guidelines here are that for mild-mod depression you try talking therapies first. severe you start antidepressants. however they should also be doing a full assessment ie taking a full history, when your problems started, why, family background, other health probs, any suicidal thoughts, symptoms of mania, psychosis, etc. and they shouldn't give you pills without saying what they think your diagnosis is. did they send you a letter? did they ask if it was ok for the med students to be there? it sounds rather inadequate to me, you could always ask for a second opinion from someone else, write a letter. seriously we get letters all the time saying people want to see someone else, or dont want to see this dr again,. shouldn't take pills with side effects unless you have to (and know why!).",

      "Around a month ago I began to feel like my brain was gradually drifting off from reality, this permanently leaves me in a dream-like state where I feel like I'm on autopilot. Immediately after waking up in the morning I feel extremely worried and upset. Usually about work or school. This feeling could persist for hours after waking up without a break. I get waves of dark/sad/worrying throughout the day, this worsens in public. I sometimes have to reassure myself there is nothing to worry about. It seems I'm always able to eat more; I tend to eat not because I'm hungry but because the taste is usually pleasurable and gives me something to enjoy, I have been trying to cut back recently. I sometimes reflect on embarrassing/unfortunate events in my past life and think of everything I could have done differently to avoid it, leaving me lost in my own anxious thoughts. Ever since a few years ago I feel increasingly self-conscious, mostly about my appearance and personality. This sometimes makes it difficult for me to speak up in conversations in fear of being insulted or rejected. Whenever I am insulted/given negative news I feel like It effects me more emotionally than it should. It bothers me usually for a while after. I react positively to good news/exciting upcoming events. I can't concentrate on one thing for more than a minute, this is severely impacting my grades. I sleep for around 6 hours or so before I wake up feeling restless, this has been happening regularly for the last week. I know there was a time when I didn't always feel this way, but I can't' remember it. The thought of being like this permanently makes me feel sad.",

      "TL;DR : I've been to a therapist, read some books, and faced up to the fact that I lived about 30 years of my life in a state of high functioning depression. I felt pretty good for a while. Lately, over the past 2 years or so, I've spent more time reflecting on my past and realized how pervasive the depression was. I hate my past self for the opportunities and experiences I missed out on. Anyone else experience this? I'm in my mid-40s and about 7 years ago in the midst of marriage counseling, realized and accepted that I'd been suffering from high functioning depression for most of my life. I was always a shy, anxious and withdrawn kid with zero self confidence. Mental illness runs in the family — between an overprotective narcissistic/BPD mother who had a traumatic childhood and depression on my father's side (an uncle who committed suicide, and a grandmother who was depressed, obviously even more so after losing my uncle), I had those possible tendencies, but add to that my parents' divorce when I was 5; a narcissistic, emotionally and verbally abusive stepfather who came in to the picture when I was 6; having to help care for 3 younger siblings; and losing 3 grandparents, an aunt, and my father between the time I was 14 and 18 — and I was not a happy person growing up. But hey, I always got good grades and stayed out of trouble, so it all looked fine on the outside. Fast-forward to my late-30s — I was in marriage counseling. There was no passion in my marriage and we had different expectations in the marriage. I expected something close to 50/50 on chores & duties while she expected someone to take care of everything for her. Between my unrecognized depression and her acknowledged depression, we weren't a good team; we didn't support each other when we needed it most. Around that time I had a major confrontation with my parents; basically, I really stood up for myself for the first time ever and they couldn't believe it. I opened up about a lot of things, confronted my parents about past issues, and the aftermath left me emotionally exhausted and I ultimately went through what was luckily an amicable divorce. Now, over the past few years as I've moved, met new people and dated, I feel much better. However, I feel like I've grown detached from my past self; looking back feels like looking back on the life of someone else, and I feel sorry for, and I guess hate that person. I missed out on a lot of happiness and joy. Yes, I did have some good times and I know I should be grateful because it always could have been worse, but I've just been wired to look more at the negative. Now, I've never been a nostalgic person, or one to reminisce about the past. I don't hold onto a lot of tradition. Aside from very early in our dating life, my ex-wife and I never really discussed our past. Now, having dated again and going through that period where you share your life stories, I've come to dread talking about my past because I just think of what could have been and I get depressed sometimes after thinking about my past. Maybe it's all at this age when people reminisce more, but the people I've met over the past few years seem to talk about their past more than others I've met at earlier times in my life. I wish I could just wipe all the memories. I suppose all of this will pass, and it won't bother me so much. But this is one aspect of healing I didn't expect. Unearthing the past and looking at it anew is not comfortable; there's pain in looking at the past with new eyes."

      "I have been clinically diagnosed with depression. Ive been struggling with apathy, emptiness, sadness, and the typical symptoms associated with Major Depressive Disorder. To give insight, my apathy goes as deep as not caring deeply(misanthropic too) about any human beings including family(not malicious) and especially, close friends. I would be affected by my relatives death but not a friend. I have zero drive or ambition to do anything, but I know it is a problem. I'm on autopilot everyday, forcing myself to interact normally with others even though I'm deeply in \"pain\". I've always been apathetic as a child, but as a teen it has been made worse (16) and some of my family members have the same problem. Medication does not help enough to change any of my behaviours. The problem with me is that I cannot assign value to anything mentally, so I lack purpose. I have tried dietary changes and I am emotionally flatlining in terms of positive emotion. Nothing ever has clicked in my brain so I deeply think it will not change anything. So, I come here to ask for advice/words that can help me through this",

      "i am trying to figure out what exact term or explanation one would give for how i would feel about something. i've always let the therapists / mental health professionals know that one of the strongest emotions i have is envy, however, as i go on and off researching the definition, something about the typical definition is not what i agree with or relate to. for example, from most of the sources i've seen, it shows envy as wishing you had something from someone else, however, this doesn't seem to be exactly what i feel. i was hoping maybe there might be a better definition or more appropriate term for what i feel exactly. for example, i've attributed myself as being a narcissist because i don't relate to most people ( personality disorder ) which i have a PD, specifically diagnosed with schizotypal PD and depression, however, unlike the definitions given for narcissism, i do not envy people because i see myself as above them in the literal sense, it is that i know i am inferior but have to see other more fortunate people with certain traits or qualitities live their lives and be the people that they are and be reasonably functional and happy where as i can't and that is where my envy comes, however, it is not because i would want those traits from them, why would i want to be like them if i despise them and see them as scums? wouldn't that itself oppose envy if you aren't desiring to be like them and you see them as scums? however, i've many times had to adjust what i say and my resentment towards the therapist(s) because mentioning how i truly feel, that i despise most people, is suggesting something really extreme, when in fact it really is, i do genuinely hate most people and have to exist in my inferior way in life, but i've had to minimize this due to safety reasons which in other words could make me blow up and become violent physically or verbally threaten people. so this is why it's hard for me to come up with a one word definition, because for me, it's a series of processes and terms that would explain how i feel or what i feel, which is why i'd look down at all those shallow people i've met in mental health groups who'd say something to me very disrespectful, untrue, and shallow, but you would not argue with these idiots and scumbags because they are well...scumbags and idiots also as a random hypothesis of my own, i feel like the whole covert and overt narcissism and grandiose / vulnerable narcissism needs better classification and understanding. how i see it is like this, covert and overt narcissism are not separate \"types\" of narcissism, nor are they qualitatively different conditions, but...., i will say that grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism are, and / or should be reclassified as such. the problem is, the majority of resources of people describing their own experience / understanding of these becomes mostly about the subgrouping of grandiose narcissist individuals in the sense of going with what and why's of the DSM criteria / explanations, yet the majority of these people are signifying it in a way that makes it seem like it's supposed to be different when all they are doing is explaining the grandiose narcissist in a covert way, nothing of which qualitatively differentiates that person from that of the vulnerable narcissist which in many ways would / should be different, but majority of sources vaguely assign definitions to which then become defined in inaccurate ways. grandiose narcissists according to research tend to be more functional / tend to do well at work / excel high in work areas and related, and overall have low emotional instability, yet people then try to put vulnerable narcissists in the same group when they are hugely different, in other words, there should be a different name for one of them, it should vulnerable PD or narcissistic PD. it's the same way where there is high range of people / or sources trying to lump up SCT ( sluggish cognitive tempo ) with ADD in the sense that they believe ADHD without hyperactivity which would normally be called ADD IS SCT when it clearly isn't, and fail to understand that ADD is just another manifestation of ADHD but that the type of problems are clearly part of the same disorder, not to mention ADD was removed from the newer DSM as it was essentially ADHD under a different name so people who can't bother to pay a little more close attention to russell barkley's videos on clarification / and the past DSM system would fail to realize that ADD/ADHD are part of the same condition. however, SCT like vulnerable narcissism probably will not get much attention because they are the more silent disorders, despite intrinsic sources that would otherwise put them as very common. I would even question russell barkley's analysis on SCT, because i feel like he tries to make SCT people look like they are compliant / inexpressive, non resentful people who do not ever make such sound judgements and all they need is a cookie and they'll feel better, he assumes that those with SCT benefit or do best / or at least SHOULD do best in CBT or social skills training when this is not true at all. espicially the case with saying \"SHY\" people do best in social skills training when there are sources that contradict this and show that certain types of shy people can actually be violent / aggressive, yet barkley classifies them as simple non resentful, non hateful, goodie too shoos. im sorry russell barkley but although i do agree with a lot of your takes on SCT vs ADHD, i do not agree with some of your statements on SCT. yes, i do understand studies on SCT are difficult and / or have been difficult up to this date, however, i feel like you put \"SCT\" into a narrow definition. also another thing to which i discussed with my therapist and see agreed with me 100 percent is the confusion with narcissism and the behavior we see today as it relates to envy and jealousy, however, because of the confusing differences, most of the behavior gets confused. what you are seeing in life is not more people becoming narcissistic, it is that more people are becoming jealous. when you see people competing after one another and the whole facebook thing, attention and what not, that's NOT envy at all, that's jealousy, all of it is influenced by jealousy and is not what narcissism is. and stop grouping people on a spectrum, it's ridiculous. it's stupid to say someone is a little narcissistic but doesn't suffer from NPD. i personally oppose the whole spectrum thing of mental health conditions. what seperates a lot of the \"mentally ill\" from \"norms\" is that norms can do this whole fake thing and do stupid $#%^ and be fine and not feel guilty about it but people like me will become psychotic if they someone find themselves unintentionally doing things / functioning like other people \"typical people\", i wont even say norms in this exert."

      "I am currently in my 3rd or 4th week of screening and will most likely be accepted into a clinical trial of an esketamine nasal spray.  I believe that they will start me on it in 1-2 weeks. I have read a great deal about the potentially life changing benefits and I'm very excited at the prospect of finally finding a medication that works for me.  On the flip side, I'm dreading the thought that this highly promising treatment won't help me. I would very much like to hear from anyone who has tried either ketamine or esketamine.  I'm talking medically supervised use, not self medication.  I have no desire to get high.",
      "I read a little bit about it.",
      "For anyone who might be interested in the Esketamine clinical trial: The study is targeted at those who have dealt with drug resistant Major Depression for an extended period of time.  The qualification parameters are quite narrow and the study requires a large time commitment. Each visit is 3-5 hours. Participants cannot have diagnoses such as BiPolar or psychoses.  I believe that cardiac issues, high blood pressure and nasal/sinus problems are also disqualifying factors. The screening portion of the trial lasts 4 weeks, consisting of twice weekly visits. Participants answer questionnaires (many, many questions) about mood and lifestyle. Participants must conduct a phone interview with a psychiatrist once per week, lasting 30-40 minutes.  Blood draws and urine samples are taken regularly. If accepted, participants begin the drug phase of the study, beginning with coming off current meds.  They are then given a new antidepressant that they have not taken in the past.  Once off old meds, Esketamine is self administered 3 times, in the form of a pre-measured nasal spray.  The sprays are taken at 5 minute intervals. Blood is drawn 4 minutes after the 3rd spray and again 1 hour later.  The participant is asked a series of questions immediately before and 1 hour after the full dose.  Participants are 'discharged' at the discretion of the attending psychiatrist and are not allowed to leave alone. This routine is also twice per week.  Participants conduct phone interviews with a psychiatrist several times per week during this phase. This is a paid study. Normally $100 per visit. The amount can vary depending on the length of each visit.  On one visit the Dr was running behind. I was there for at least 5 hours and was paid $200.  Payment is in the form of a prepaid MasterCard supplied to the participant on the first visit.  Money is added to the card at the end of each visit and is immediately available. I have thus far had 2 doses of Esketamine.  Because of the effects, I am certain that I am not receiving the placebo.  Within seconds of a inhalation I get a feeling similar to gas at the dentist's office although far milder. In my case, this feeling completely dissipates after 2-3 minutes. (I got the impression from the psychiatrist that in others it lasts up to an hour.)  There's an unpleasant post nasal drip taste but again, it is short lived.  Slight sniffles; also short lived. I'm extremely pleased to report that there was a noticeable difference in my mood immediately after the first dose.  I felt far less 'trapped in my head.'  At one point on the following day, I realized that I was grinning to myself.  Completely out of character.  The daily 'I wish I was dead' thoughts have disappeared.  Anxiety has decreased. Increased appetite. More sleep.  I feel a sense of hope for the first time in forever.  Very, very encouraging. I apologize for babbling but sincerely hope that someone finds this information helpful.",
      "I'm in the same or similar trial.  I get my first dose on 9/30.  I'd love to hear how you're feeling a few months out.  I really hope this works for me.  I'd love to feel normal again.",
      "tiffany978 wrote: I'm in the same or similar trial.  I get my first dose on 9/30.  I'd love to hear how you're feeling a few months out.  I really hope this works for me.  I'd love to feel normal again. Congratulations, Tiffany!  This is such a difficult study to qualify for.  The clinic I go to only has 1 other person who qualified. I completed the main study and signed on for the follow-up phase.  Dosing drops from twice a week to once a week to every other week.   I haven't had a dose in 13 days and I can feel myself sliding backwards some.  Isolating mostly, which has been my M.O. for almost 2 decades.  Thankfully, the 'wish I was dead' thoughts haven't returned.  (knock on wood) It's my understanding that this drug is having positive results on the majority so, assuming that you don't get the placebo, (you'll know if you get the drug) I think it's safe to say that you'll feel at least some relief. Keep in touch and let us know how it works out for you.  Best of luck!!",
      "Update - 1 Year Later Sunk fast after the end of the study. Got new scripts for my former meds but after the resounding success of the esketamine, I didn't bother filling the scripts. They're basically useless on me. Pre-study, I was taking lamotragine and something else. Possibly Prozac. Can't remember. Prior to that, I'd been on everything from Prozac to lithium. The only meds that ever helped were diazepam and seroquel, both taken for sleep. Upon moving, the new clinic decided not to prescribe them. No idea why. Anyway, nothing lifted the depression and now my sleep is so fkd up it's ridiculous. For the past year I've been a sedentary hermit. Only get out of bed when I have to. Quit smoking for 7 months (during the study) and then started again after it ended. Gained 40lbs. Feel and look terrible. Every day I tell myself that I'm going to exercise, eat right and lose weight. I never do it. I'm just marking time and wondering if I can wait out the 5 or more years it will take for esketamine to be reviewed and hopefully approved by the FDA. I attend weekly group therapy, not because it helps the depression but because it gets me up and out. I dread it every week but so far I'm still going. I guess my point is that the differences between the Before/During/After of the drug study are dramatic. On a visual chart it would look like an upside down V. Not good at all.",
      "I had Ketamine infusions,it worked while I was receiving it but I too \"plunged\" after the treatments ended. My Pdoc tells me I need maintenance treatments, but at $500 per infusion it's just not realistic.",
      "Witchy wrote: I had Ketamine infusions,it worked while I was receiving it but I too \"plunged\" after the treatments ended. My Pdoc tells me I need maintenance treatments, but at $500 per infusion it's just not realistic. Hi Witchy.  I'm sorry to hear that you had a similar experience after coming off Ketamine.  I did a lot of research into infusions and was floored by what I found. Aside from it's intended use as an anesthetic, Ketamine is used as a boutique drug by unscrupulous doctors who charge insane fees. It's disgraceful. Any doctor whose bottom line is 'I'll help you ... if you can afford me,' is the scum of the earth in my book.",
      "On Sept 4, 2018, Janssen Pharmaceuticals announced that they filed a New Drug Approval application for intranasal esketamine with the FDA.  Average time for FDA approval of a new drug is 7-12 yrs.  That includes trials, etc.  It could conceivably take a minimum of 2 yrs before esketamine is approved.  The upside is that Esketamine has been placed on the Compassionate Use list. FDA on Compassionate Use https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHe ... ndedAccess Janssen Compassionate Use Request https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-u ... e-requests Janssen Policies and Principles https://www.janssen.com/compassionate-u ... principles If you have treatment resistant Major Depressive Disorder, look for an esketamine clinical trial in your area.  Otherwise, you can talk to your doctor about the possibility of applying for early access to the drug.",
      "Update on Intranasal Esketamine: It was reported on February 12, 2019 that the FDA Psychopharmacologic Drug Advisory Committee recommended Spravato (intranasal esketamine) for approval. It has been reported in a number of medical journals that the new drug is expected to receive final FDA approval on or by March 4, 2019. Estimates on when newly approved drugs reach the market range from 6 months to a year.  The process could take less time. It all depends on how much advance work Janssen did on marketing and insurance. Downside is that the Advisory Committee doesn't trust patients to self-administer at home. Users will have to go to a healthcare provider's office, receive a dose and then remain for 1-2 hours to ensure that disassociative and sedation side effects have subsided."

      "For several years, I thought I was going to end up unhappy and depressed for the rest of my life. After learning to spend time alone, I learned that I was not the one making me feel unhappy. It was the people around me making me feel miserable. I learned that only by saying good-bye to all my toxic friends would I achieve happiness. You know what? It worked.

      "Hi all, I found out a few months ago that I was given the \"diagnostic impression\" of Recurring MDD. These results came out two years ago, but no one gave me my packet at the time; I had to ask my parents repeatedly while applying to colleges (where I am now). Because the only formal diagnosis I was informed of was ADHD, I assumed that this \"diagnostic impression\" meant that I didn't actually fit the criteria... Or that I may have fit the criteria, but for whatever reason, I was not given a diagnosis and therefore did not qualify. I haven't been tracking my moods, because of that. I haven't been identifying my lows as possible depressive episodes, because I wasn't aware that I should have been -- I assumed they were just ADHD-related burn outs and that I just needed a weekend to be \"fine\" again. However, after being reminded of the impression, I finally asked an old therapist what that meant, and she said she was very confused -- that I should have recieved a diagnosis. Two years ago. tldr; As you may imagine, I'm rather pissed. Anyhow, I think that I may also be suffering from PDD, because even when I'm \"high\"... I'm not exactly happy. Just functioning alright. My brief flashes of a genuinely good, unexplained mood, are so potent and obvious that for a while, I wondered if I had BPD, because it felt akin to mania. I realize that it wasn't, now. Just, happiness. Anyway, I'll be speaking to a professional about this next Friday, finally trying to get all my symptoms on the table and find out what's really wrong. I'm not seeking a diagnosis here -- I'll get that soon enough. But I do have a question. Assuming that I really will be diagnosed with Recurring MDD as I should have been, as well as possibly PDD... How do I know when I'm entering an episode? If I'm always a bit sad, then \"sad moods\" should feel crushing as well, should they not? How do I know the difference between situational \"depression\" and a true depressive episode, as part of my condition? Especially when situational factors can TRIGGER these episodes as well? I don't want to claim to a friend \"I think I'm having a depressive episode\" if I'm not... but I also don't want to feel like I'm just being dramatic and sad when I'm actually depressed again... Hopefully, you see my dilemma. Thanks, Pitch"

      "I never feel like I am good enough. I've never felt like I was good enough and I've always felt worthless. I think it starts from my dad, who I've always just wanted to please. He's been working hard his entire life, and he's always said things that made me feel like Im not good enough or that made me seem like I'm the bad side and I'm always the one that has to end up feeling guilty and  wrong. So I was never able to please him, so I've always strived for perfectionism subconsciously, and I've always found that whenever an authority figure, like a teacher, would criticize me, I always feel this weird hurt. It's like I want to do everything good and I feel like I'm not supposed to make a  mistake. And when I am criticised, I tell myself all the things like 'its okay' and 'youre good enough' and 'you don't have to be perfect' but I feel like it doesn't sink down and I still feel inadequate. I also don't feel good enough because I just don't feel good enough as a person. I feel like I'm not good enough in art, my drawings are stuff and proportions all wrong, not good enough in dance, I'm so stiff and awkward in dancing, and not in writing, talking, socializing, etc. I never feel good enough, I never feel pretty enough, I always feel like my flaws are the worst a human could have, and I feel like the worst person in the world because I have so much trouble expressing myself. Everyone around seem to be doing great and talking normally and I get anxiety with just eye contact with a person, and the littlest things that people seem to be able to do normally. And I'm so tired of myself for never feeling good enough, and not being able to express myself. And I spent my whole live giving and giving to my older sister because she was the depressed one and I had to comfort her, feel sympathy for her, and all that, and I never took care of myself. And when I started going through difficult times and tried to talk with her about it, she would bring my problems back to her and talk about her own problems, and I still feel angry deep down, at her for that, for all her selfishness in our relationship, for not giving back. And now today she's all happy and self-improvement and I'm still here stuck, not knowing how to express myself, and I don't feel comfortable expressing my feelings to others because I'm just so used to listening and listening to someone else's problems (my sister). Today I am always thinking about how something I do could be affecting someone else because I'm always scared that I'm a burden to someone. I'm scared to tell my feelings to others because I'm afraid I will be like how my sister was like to me. And I don't have a lot of friends at all, so I feel like I don't have anyone there for me like I am for anyone, but I feel like I'm not supposed to be telling my problems, and tatI should always be the one listening. I have 2 close friends, but I'm scared of getting too close for some reason, and one of them drains me a bit. I'm always scared my friends will leave me, as that has happened before multiple times in the past, and it hurts, but I know it was because of me each time. The only person I could potentially feel okay with telling my emotions and everything to, is another sister of mine, she was the first person I've ever vented to, and that was only a few years ago. We've always been super close because she's only a year older than me, and we've shared our entire childhood together. But now, we're still close, but she hangs out with her friends all the time, and I don't feel as special to her anymore, and it hurts because she's still really special in my life, but I'm not in hers. I only see her in the mornings and weekends nowadays because she's always coming back from hanging out with her friends by the time I'm asleep. And even when she is here or next to me, she's always busy with something else or on her phone. On her phone all the time, talking to someone else because she's such an amazing person and has a lot of friends, everywhere. So now I'm just not feel like I'm good enough. My sister who I've felt has been selfish to me is now up and about, all happy, and good with everything in her life, she has the perfect body, mindset, everyone likes her, and if something goes wrong with her, I still feel like Im supposed to be the one who listens again, and feel sorry and worthless and again until she gets back up and I'm still feeling worthless, and that my problems don't matter. I'm sorry this vent has been so long, I've just got so much going on right now that I just needed to vent out what I've been feeling and thinking about. I've been trying to forgive her, forgive my dad, and I'm getting there. I just want to be happy, I just want everyone to be happy. It means that world to me if someone out there has read all my jumbles emotions and thoughts. Thank you for reading this all. ♥️"

      "I started a new job around ten days ago. My work experience and knowledge comes from mental health background. This new role includes outreach human trafficking. A subject I have zero experience and knowledge on. I took on this new role as it offered better salary than my last job. No weekend working and proper office hours. So I felt it could offer a better stablity whilst I study outside of work preferrably in the evenings. I was informed new staffs are joining due to the expansion of the service. On my first day, I was so overwhelmed by the amount of information thrown at me. I ended up being sick during my lunch break. The second day, I was asked to shadow someone. This role includes outreach in all parts of London. So it will include meeting with victims of human trafficking. You meet with them in local places. You give them money and support them whilst the home office makes a decision. I was overwhelmed to learn that each worker gets given a payment card to withdrawel money and has to carry around a lot of money for the client's. It's quite a huge responsibility as when giving over payments to clients in public places. This can make you a target for someone to rob you when they know and watch you with money. I have been shadowing different people. The worker's have a background in working with this client group in their previous roles. They have the experience and knowledge and do their work really well. These client's - there are a lot of challenges that I feel so unqualified to deal with. Client's can't speak English. Client's don't have proper housing. Client's don't have GP surgery's. All the worker's seem to have the knowledge and experience in supporting the clients. When they get given new client's, they know the right questions to ask. On my third day into the new role. I was allocated a caseload of 15 clients. I began to feel incredibly overwhelmed and shocked to learn the fast pace with wanting to throw new staff into the deep end so quickly without having the revelant training. 15 client's I have been allocated - some can't speak English. Some are pregnant. All need money. I feel incredibly out of my depth. I don't have the experience nor knowledge in supporting them. I feel so overwhelmed with just having 15 clients thrown at me at just my third day into the new job. I have also learnt due to the paperwork overload. People are staying much later after they should be working. Staff whom are contracted to work from Monday to Friday are in fact coming into the office on their weekend off just to complete their paperwork. Management are aware of this but don't care. I feel so disgusted and not impressed as this can cause staff to burn out quickly. Staff who are working over their hours are not getting paid for overtime. Instead they are just allowed one toil day off per month. The client's I have taken on - I was shocked to observe their previous Support Worker has given them their personal number to keep in contact with them. The worker has done everything for one particular client to the point this client is phoning the worker up and becoming to clingy. I pointed out to the worker boundaries are needed. We are to empower the client's and not do everything for them. I have now being left to pick up the pieces of bad habits to the previous worker has done to the clients. That's pressure I don't need. I spoke to my manager about how I am feeling. She was incredibly scared in case I resign. She informed me they have a high staff turnover. One new staff started three weeks ago. By the third day into the new role, he resigned. Every week there is an email that someone is leaving. She has promised me she is there to support me. But I'm just not feeling I will remain long in this new job. I'm highly tempted in resigning within the next day or so. I feel overwhelmed, stressed, cheated, under qualified and not impressed with what I have seen so far. I don't have the knowledge, tools nor experience to support one client little than 15 clients. I'm feeling extremely regrettful with leaving my last job. They are struggling at the moment as they have low staff. I'm tempted with asking HR for my old job back as I miss my old job and team so much. I wish I had stayed as I loved my old job so much. Any advice?"

      "Hello there, first post, nice to meet you all! Recently my depression has been really bad (what a way to kick off the new year lol). I've lost track of all time, I'm letting my schoolwork slide, my room's a mess, I'm a mess, and I have no motivation to do anything at all. I've read so many articles about how to deal with a depression episode, but they're all for curing the simple blues. They never mention how hard it is to get up in the morning and find worth in what you do. I guess my question is, what do you do to help yourself back up when you're having trouble? Thank you so much for reading, I hope you're having a wonderful day. <3"

      "Hi everyone, I am a 24 year old male. After taking Amitriptyline 10 mg/day for two weeks I stopped realizing it’s side-effects such as daytime sleeplessness, intense emotional feeling, crying etc. I cried almost everyday but once a day for almost two months remembering my childhood memories with my parents. Now after six months I still feel some blockage on my head. It seems my aim, hopes, future-plans etc. are blocked from being interesting. For example, if I think about a good job, now I find nothing worthy or interesting but I should find benefits such as good quality of life in a good job. What's wrong with me ?"

      "I think I may have almost been kidnapped as a child.  I was in the first or second grade, can't remember for sure which one, and we were told as children during a child safety program that if ANY unfamiliar adult tells us to go to their car for ANY reason, that we were to yell \"No!\" and run the other way.  So I was arranged to be picked up by my grandmother most days out of the week, where I would do my homework and would walk back to my mum's house (which was on the same farm property).  Anyways, it was always my mum or grandmother who picked me up from school.  One day my grandmother (who was running late) hadn't shown up to school yet, and I was outside in the pick-up zone, waiting for her, when this old woman tells me she has a litter of puppies in the back seat of her van and asks me if I'd like to see.  She had on a black shirt, a gray knit jacket, black pants and black shoes.  She pointed at a gray van with the back door open, and sort of starred at me with this forced look on her face.  She LOOKED like a teacher, and school is ALL about taking tests right?  So I figured this was a test and tomorrow we would all be graded on our reaction, so of course I said \"No!\"  and ran the other way back towards the crowd of kids and parents.  I looked over my shoulder at her.  All of the adults starred at her, and she sort of backed off like I'd drawn attention to her and she looked embarrassed though she kept smiling.   Eventually my grandma showed up, I got into her truck and we dove off.  I wonder now what was actually happening.  A little old lady wasn't exactly what we were being taught to avoid as the images and example videos we watched were all of adult men...was she some senile old woman looking for a little girl in the wake of a terrible loss?  Or was she just some sick woman looking for her husband's new sex toy?  I COULD have been the next missing child on a poster hanging in the post office, but I'm still here.  Did she nab someone else? Did some other little girl suffer a fate worse than death?  I may never know.  I never told anyone and it still bothers me.  I could have witnessed a child abductor in the act and wasn't smart enough to say anything.  My mother aborted two children before I was born... AND one, maybe more kids in or around the Sacramento area of California could have been kidnapped, tortured and maybe worse.  I still haven't told my mum about the possible attempted kidnapping.  I don't know if I should.  I feel responsible for not telling anyone.  If I said something, I could have stopped any other incidents,  but I was stupid enough to believe that my marks in the first/second year of grade school were the only thing at stake. I've been suicidally depressed for most of my life and I wonder now if I had vanished or ceased to exist 15 or 20 years ago,  if someone better than myself could have gotten to live."

      "Hello everyone. So, I qualify as having Bipolar II depression, but I thought I would post here instead of in the bipolar forum as I am mostly dealing with depression here. I've been taking Abilify as a mood stabilizer and for my depressive symptoms, but I think that maybe the medication has stopped working for me. Lately, I've just been feeling so sad and like I want to hurt myself. I'm not going to hurt myself, but the urges have been there and they've been difficult to deal with. I feel very hopeless right now too, like I'll never be able to find the right combination of medications for me. I'm ashamed that I have to take any medications at all, but thanks to the chronic fatigue from the depression, I have to keep taking medications. It's terrible.",
      "Have you tried non-drug therapies? Massage? Light therapy? Fish oil? 5-HTP, DHEA, choline or lecithin may help.",
      "Parador wrote: Have you tried non-drug therapies? Massage? Light therapy? Fish oil? 5-HTP, DHEA, choline or lecithin may help. I've actually tried a lot of the things that you have listed. Some of them help just a tiny bit, but they don't make the depression go away or manage it very much. But thank you for the suggestions all the same.",
      "Is your doctor helping you with this? Have other classes of medications been tried? There are options for medication-resistant cases, like ECT, etc. As long as you have more options open for you to try, it is never hopeless. Best of luck to you.",
      "I’m pretty hopeless here as well. In my experience and readings antidepressants and antipsychotics are ineffective and just give you side effects. I’ve been on over 15 different medications and done Electro shock. Still miserable as hell. Sounds like you’ve tried a lot of different things. Have you ever tried a psychedelic such as magic mushrooms? The FDA just granted magic mushrooms breakthrough therapy status for major depression. Magic mushrooms and other psychedelics have gone through a few clinical trials and they performed miracles compared to standard SSRI’s. With one trip people got sustained benefits for up to years. I’m currently trying to get my hands on magic mushrooms. A friend of mine is in the prossess of getting them. Researchers have done some research on how psychedelics treat mental illness. If you want me to post all I know on how they work ask and I’ll do so. Another unconventional  option is CBD. CBD is a chemical in marijuana. It does not get you high. There is some evidence it can treat mental illness. You can smoke it, eat it, or tincture it in your gums. You need to make sure you are getting CBD and not THC which is the other chemical in marijuana."

      "I'm 28 now and feel like my entire life has just been a massive failure.  I have been overprotected by my parents, bullied at school, never had one person I could look up to.  Being a Christian and having been brought up in church I have always led a morally correct life which has meant never drinking, smoking, taking drugs and saving sex for marriage.  I have had a few serious relationships and been on numerous dates with different girls but end of the day right now I am still single and painfully lonely and still waiting to experience sex with the right woman. I think ever since I was around 13/14 I have been battling a depression/sadness, a persistent negativity and anxiety which has stayed with me ever since.  I went to a great school and then finished university in 2005 with a theology degree and since then the only jobs I've ever done have been boring administration temp jobs, the longest of which lasted 4 months.  In total I've only worked about a year in total and so been out of work for a total of 6 years and counting.  This is NOT because I am lazy.  It is partly due to the fact that I have no idea what I want to do with my life along with this overwhelming sadness, apathy and a complete and utter lack of desire and interest to do anything.  I just don't care about anything.  I have NEVER had a sense of ambition, I have no goals, no real aspirations, I just have nothing to live for, absolutely nothing.  Just feels like my entire life has been a complete waste and I keep thinking that the best thing to do would be to commit suicide.  I always thought that finding the right woman would give me a real purpose and happiness and joy in my life.  But that hasn't happened and because I feel this way and never seem to get better, I fear I never will.  Because afterall, don't they say you have to be happy with yourself and your situation and circumstances before you can be with someone.  Well if that's the case I haven't got a hope.   It already feels like I've missed the boat.  I have a good personality, I'm decent looking, I'm easy going and intelligent but that doesn't seem to be enough. I've tried everything. I've been on anti depressants, seen therapists, counsellors, career counsellors, spoken to career advisors, done career tests, written down all my interests and skills, voluntary work all in an attempt to make a decision on doing something, but I still can't figure out why I seem paralysed and unable to move on with my life. The voluntary roles I had I just simply lost interest in.  The medication didn't seem to alter my mood.  The career tests just made me go round in circles and the counsellors and therapists I saw actually made things worse.  There was only one counsellor who really understood me.  As a Christian I thought that at least my faith should give me hope to continue and to keep believing that God does have a plan for my life.  But due to all the rejection and setbacks over the years my Christian faith has suffered and now I hate God as a result. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE??  Is it just severe depression or something else? Obviously I have condensed my life story here in brief but from what you've read give me one good reason why I should not end my life?  I have absolutely nothing to live for whatsoever.  Despite my best efforts nothing ever seems to change, infact life just seems to get worse.  Not existing anymore seems to be a far better option than having to endure the pain and agony of having to face each day  alone, empty and lost, without hope or purpose.  I know I need a focus, an aim, some sense that my life is going somewhere and that I have purpose but I have tried to find it for so many years and failed.   I am so fed up of it all.",
      "Don't lose faith, keep searching for something that will help you. Therapy, medication or maybe a renewal of faith. Persistence and faith in yourself is the only thing that is going to get you out of where you are, you have to rely on and have faith in yourself. Keep trying talk therapy",
      "There are thousands of reasons why you should not end your life. However, I completely agree with MrMental, that you need to find the faith in yourself. I know it feel absolutely hopeless right now, but trust me, it gets much easier with time and it gets better. Things always get better. Also, if you can, please bring this to your therapist. They don't want you to feel like miserable, and if you communicate everything to them, they can  help you much better. My heart goes out to you, I know how it feels.",
      "Dont worry. you are still young and plenty of life to lead. Be positive. Hope for the better years to come.",
      "I am sorry that you're going through a tough time from February 1.  I can relate since I have been going through something similar in my life.  It's tough, I know.  I think about taking my own life, but going up as a Christian myself I don't want to go to hell.  I am driven to find a job.  I get out by helping others with education and the environment.  I have a passion for that.  I think in ways of how I can give back to society.  Oh yeah, there were/are times that I think I am just taking up space.  But I indeed keep going.  In a deep and sorrowful time in my life, I went walking.  It was hard to step out of the door and make that effort.  I didn't want to try, but I did it and within a week, I was feeling a lot better.  I listen to my favorite music and go walking along a park, next to a lake.  Spending time with friends helps too.  If you don't have many friends, you can join a club (a club that may spark interests).  I have done it and made friends because we have/had the same interests. I have been in relationships myself.  But I haven't found the right person.  I do too fear that I am destined to live alone.  Scary?  Of course!  But I have to tell myself with positive confirmations that may be my purpose is to be or not to be with someone because what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  I would love to be in a committed relationship but I feel that I have to get myself better before I take care of someone in that way.  In the meantime, I help others and build relationships based on interests and volunteering. It's hard not knowing where you go from here.  I have good days and bad days.  But I think it takes courage and persistence to find something to make you feel like you do have a place in this world.  I know I do because my passion is to help others because in return they help me to keep going. I wish you well and hope you find what you're looking for.",
      "EDITED BY MODERATOR... Is there anything you would like to do that you have never done because of moral restraint, busyness, etc.? I am not saying do unethical things, but I think that trying to be good and perfect all the time might lead to depression because it is simply impossible. Might as well try something new. (as long as it does not hurt others/yourself or break the law) What things do you like to do when you have absolutely nothing to do or worry about?",
      "Chrona, forgive me if I'm mistaken, but I don't think you're God--so how do you know who goes to hell and who doesn't? If you think threatening a depressed person with hell is a good way to dissuade them from suicide, you need some serious education. The moralistic tone of your \"advice\" makes me really wonder if you've ever been truly depressed. If not, kindly stick to dispensing \"advice\" regarding things you actually have experienced.",
      "I'm 21 and feel like my entire life has just been a massive failure. I have been overprotected by my parents, bullied at school, never had one person I could look up to. Being a Catholic and having been brought up in church I have always led a morally correct life which has meant never drinking, smoking, taking drugs and saving sex for marriage. I have had no relationships and been on a few dates with different girls but end of the day I am still single and painfully lonely. Also, I'm a college drop out, I was interested in Psychology and Theology. I've been isolated at home for the past 8 months because of my confusion and lack of will to participate in this world anymore. I have no real friends. I hate life and God. I think we have a few things in common John, what do you think.",
      "Hi John, I sometimes have the same thoughts. People could say positive things, but it wouldn't make me feel better. I got really tired of people saying that it will get better and be positive. If you really believe that life doesn't matter, and no one and nothing can change that, you could end your life. About the hell thing, it seems like you're already experiencing it. Just know that most people who attempted suicide ended up regretting it in the last few seconds. If all of your problems can be changed when someone loves you and/or when you have a career, you should not end your life. Those are very circumstantial things, if you wait for a little bit longer, you might just have it all. If you need aspirations and hopes, make them. For example, move to a different country, where English speaking is such an essential skill that you can make a career out of it. A change of environment makes me feel better. I guess my point is do whatever you want, but you have to contemplate the pros and cons of both living and being dead. Life definitely brings a lot of difficulties, but it also comes with worthwhile rewards. You could give up both altogether, or take the difficulties and and take your rewards.",
      "It's extremely ignorant and harmful to tell people with a psychiatric illness they will go to hell...this idea belongs back in the middle ages. It's very sad that in this day and age there is still so much ignorance and judgment towards people who have a psychiatric illness...it's not their fault just like cancer is not the persons fault....anyone who knows even a little bit about psych illness know that suicide is not something the person wants to do, it happens out of despair when they can't cope with the level of despair, which is not their fault.....I hope and pray one day soon people will understand psychiatric illness such as depression occurs because of an abnormality in the persons brain , it happens on a physiological level the same way cancer diabetes etc does"

      "I was wondering if any board members have been taking Amitriptyline or Nortriptyline for Depression and Anxiety? I have been on Zoloft for months but it hasn't been particularly helpful treating the Depression. My doctor has recommended Amitrip as an excellent antidepressant. I responded very well to another TCA called Clomipramine some years ago but it stopped working. My biggest concern are the side effects. He said expect to gain weight on the Amitrip. Has anyone had weight gain as a side effect but have been able to manage it with diet and exercise? I'm concerned that I won't be able to lose the possible weight even with a lifestyle change. Hair loss is also a concern but I don't know how common that is with this med. Nortriptyline is another option and is a metabolite of Amitrip but I don't know if its as effective or whether the chances of having the same side effects are pretty high. Any personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!"

      "Hi there. 15F, no family history of mental illness, no trauma, I have ADD and aspergers if that makes anything any different. I was diagnosed with situational depression w/ self harm and suicidal thoughts and prescribed prozac when I was 12 after something as simple as a fallout with friends, starting out with coming out as gay to my best friend / crush and her pushing me away. It was also complicated by struggles with accepting my sexuality and struggling with my religion as well. It is stupid, I know. I won't go into detail but I'll just say I was in a lot of pain, however I don't like talking about it because I feel like I am trivializing people with real problems. Anyways, the situation was forever ago and I'm long over it. But I still have depression symptoms. Not as bad as they used to be, in fact my therapist says I'm improving a lot. But, for the past 2 years I've been stuck in this state of emotional numbness, feeling disconnected from myself, others, and the world; and time doesn't seem to be passing. I also still hate my guts. All for no particular reason. Is it because I've never let myself healthily recover from the original situational depression? Or because of how hard I ingrained a self-loathing and negative attitude in my mind? I'm not sure. I have no good reason to be depressed if it's not situational. Nothing else is wrong with my life. I just FEEL empty. Is this just a teenager thing? Why am I still depressed if the event that triggered it has been resolved? I just want to find a reason why. Any insight would be great.",

      "There's nothing left to try. I have nothing but pain. Unending pain. Never trust yiur dentist. He killed me destoyed my life. Put in veneers with cemenet i was allergic to. I had it taken out and crowns. But I'm allergic to porelan crowns too., That's the only thing they make crowns out of - porcelain or acrylic . And I'm allergic to both. I'm in intense pain now. There is no relief. I hae been to 8 dentists and they have no answers. Most say it's impossible, that dental materials are totally inert. They say there's nothing they can do. I can do something. I can die. I don;t own a gun. I know someone who drove his car into a ledge. I can do that. I don't know how much longer I can hold out. I am going to see if a dentist will pull my teeth. Probably won't because it's so impossible for dental materials to cause problems. Pain. Too much pain.",
      "Hey Parador, Just hold out some more, please?  There is still some fighting left to do in this world for you.  Do you want them idiots to get away with how they've treated you in your life?  I'm referring to everyone here, and not just the incompetent dentist (whom you could probably take a legal case against).  Get back on your feet and start barking at the world.

Okay, that's not making much sense.  Parador, you're doing great by coming here to talk about this.  It means that you still feel that there is hope left in this world, because you are looking (albeit subconsciously) for a way out of your problems (and I'm not just talking about suicide). I mean, why have you come here? - Because you know that there are people here with whom you relate to.  Why not try that in life? - i.e. stick to things that you are familiar with.  Try to plan your days out in order to keep your stress-levels to a minimum.",
      "I want people to know what happened if I don't post anymore. Maybe you can help. I need dental material made of synthetic enamel. It is possible bu nobody does it. maybe they will in 10 years, but I can't hold out that long. Do they use it in Europe?",
      "I know very little of the state of dentistry in Europe, but I imagine that it varies immensely from nation to nation.  After a brief search online, however, I have read reports of a synthetic-enamel paste that can be used instead drilling holes in a persons teeth.  Here is the reference: http://www.colgate.com/app/Colgate/US/O ... Paste.cvsp Look, Parador, we take massive hits like this every once-in-a-while (I'm referring to the cock-up at the dentist); but please just take it easy for the time being.  You'll be back on your feet eventually. Kevin PS - It's 1:15AM here now and I'm going to go to bed.  Please just write me an email or something if you want to; or just send me a PM.  Don't just sit there and let the thoughts 'simmer' in your head.",

I never mentioned it to you that I have a chronic illness which results in me being in either constant pain or discomfort.  I find the idea of suicide attractive - sure - but I just keep hanging in there and 'fighting on'.",
      "No painkiller will work. It's like having a mouth full of chalk. It's much worse when I talk. Maybe if I cut out my tongue.  Sometimes I stick a mento to the back of my teeth. Helps a bit. I drink so much diet soda that I feel sick. Just got an e-mail back from Ivoclar - company that makes porcelain. They gave me a number to call. I want to see if anyone else has had this.

      "The Depression (Major Depressive Disorder) Forum is for the discussion of Depression and related topics. Please remember that children may be reading this particular forum and post appropriately. Major Depressive Disorder Description Major depressive disorder (also known as recurrent depressive disorder, clinical depression, major depression, unipolar depression, or unipolar disorder) is a mental disorder characterized by an all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low self-esteem, and by loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. The term \"major depressive disorder\" was selected by the American Psychiatric Association to designate this symptom cluster as a mood disorder in the 1980 version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), and has become widely used since. The general term depression is often used to denote the disorder; but as it can also be used in reference to other types of psychological depression, it is disfavored over more precise terminology for the disorder in clinical and research use. Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, around 3.4% of people with major depression commit suicide, and up to 60% of people who commit suicide had depression or another mood disorder. Major Depressive Disorder DSM IV-TR Criteria Code: Select all Major Depressive Episode A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note:  Do note include symptoms that are clearly due to a general medical condition, or mood-incongruent delusions or hallucinations. (1) depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood. (2) markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others) (3) significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gains. (4) insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day (5) psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down) (6) fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day (7) feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick) (8) diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others) (9) recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide B. The symptoms do not meet criteria for a Mixed Episode. C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism). E. The symptoms are not better accounted for by Bereavement, i.e., after the loss of a loved one, the symptoms persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation. Single Episode A.  Presence of a single Major Depressive Episode B.  The Major Depressive Episode is not better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder and is not superimposed on Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform Disorder, Delusional Disorder, or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. C. There has never been a Manic Episode, a Mixed Episode, or a Hypomanic Episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like, mixed-like, or hypomanic-like episodes are substance or treatment induced or are due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition. Major Depressive Disorder Recurrent A.  Presence of two or more Major Depressive Episodes. Note: To be considered separate episodes, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months in which criteria are not met for a Major Depressive Episode. B.   The Major Depressive Episodes are not better accounted for by Schizoaffective Disorder and are not superimposed on Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform Disorder, Delusional Disorder, or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. C.  There has never been a Manic Episode, a Mixed Episode, or a Hypomanic Episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all the manic-like, mixed-like, or hypomanic-like episodes are substance or treatment induced or are due to the direct physiological effects or a general medical condition. Specify (for current or most recent episode): Severity/Psychotic/Remission Specifiers Chronic With Catatonic Features With Atypical Features With Postpartum Onset Specify Longitudinal Course Specifiers (With and Without Interepisode Recovery) With Seasonal Pattern American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. (c) 2000 American Psychiatric Association. http://www.psych.org/ ADHD ICD-10 Criteria Code: Select all F33 Recurrent Depressive Disorder The disorder is characterized by repeated episodes of depression as specified in depressive episode (mild, moderate, or severe), without any history of independent episodes of mood elevation and overactivity that fulfill the criteria of mania. However, the category should still be used if there is evidence of brief episodes of mild mood elevation and overactivity which fulfill the criteria of hypomania immediately after a depressive episode (sometimes apparently precipitated by treatment of a depression). The age of onset and the severity, duration, and frequency of the episodes of depression are all highly variable. In general, the first episode occurs later than in bipolar disorder, with a mean age of onset in the fifth decade. Individual episodes also last between 3 and 12 months (median duration about 6 months) but recur less frequently. Recovery is usually complete between episodes, but a minority of patients may develop a persistent depression, mainly in old age (for which this category should still be used). Individual episodes of any severity are often precipitated by stressful life events; in many cultures, both individual episodes and persistent depression are twice as common in women as in men. The risk that a patient with recurrent depressive disorder will have an episode of mania never disappears completely, however many depressive episodes he or she has experienced. If a manic episode does occur, the diagnosis should change to bipolar affective disorder. Recurrent depressive episode may be subdivided, as below, by specifying first the type of the current episode and then (if sufficient information is available) the type that predominates in all the episodes. Includes: recurrent episodes of depressive reaction, psychogenic depression, reactive depression, seasonal affective disorder recurrent episodes of endogenous depression, major depression, manic depressive psychosis (depressed type), psychogenic or reactive depressive psychosis, psychotic depression, vital depression Excludes: recurrent brief depressive episodes F32 Depressive Episode In typical depressive episodes of all three varieties described below (mild, moderate, and severe), the individual usually suffers from depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to increased fatiguability and diminished activity. Marked tiredness after only slight effort is common. Other common symptoms are: reduced concentration and attention; reduced self-esteem and self-confidence; ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode); bleak and pessimistic views of the future; ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide; disturbed sleep; diminished appetite. The lowered mood varies little from day to day, and is often unresponsive to circumstances, yet may show a characteristic diurnal variation as the day goes on. As with manic episodes, the clinical presentation shows marked individual variations, and atypical presentations are particularly common in adolescence. In some cases, anxiety, distress, and motor agitation may be more prominent at times than the depression, and the mood change may also be masked by added features such as irritability, excessive consumption of alcohol, histrionic behaviour, and exacerbation of pre-existing phobic or obsessional symptoms, or by hypochondriacal preoccupations. For depressive episodes of all three grades of severity, a duration of at least 2 weeks is usually required for diagnosis, but shorter periods may be reasonable if symptoms are unusually severe and of rapid onset. Some of the above symptoms may be marked and develop characteristic features that are widely regarded as having special clinical significance. The most typical examples of these \"somatic\" symptoms are: loss of interest or pleasure in activities that are normally enjoyable; lack of emotional reactivity to normally pleasurable surroundings and events; waking in the morning 2 hours or more before the usual time; depression worse in the morning; objective evidence of definite psychomotor retardation or agitation (remarked on or reported by other people); marked loss of appetite; weight loss (often defined as 5% or more of body weight in the past month); marked loss of libido. Usually, this somatic syndrome is not regarded as present unless about four of these symptoms are definitely present. The categories of mild, moderate and severe depressive episodes described in more detail below should be used only for a single (first) depressive episode. Further depressive episodes should be classified under one of the subdivisions of recurrent depressive disorder. These grades of severity are specified to cover a wide range of clinical states that are encountered in different types of psychiatric practice. Individuals with mild depressive episodes are common in primary care and general medical settings, whereas psychiatric inpatient units deal largely with patients suffering from the severe grades. Acts of self-harm associated with mood (affective) disorders, most commonly self-poisoning by prescribed medication, should be recorded by means of an additional code from Chapter XX of ICD-10 (X60-X84). These codes do not involve differentiation between attempted suicide and \"parasuicide\", since both are included in the general category of self-harm. Differentiation between mild, moderate, and severe depressive episodes rests upon a complicated clinical judgement that involves the number, type, and severity of symptoms present. The extent of ordinary social and work activities is often a useful general guide to the likely degree of severity of the episode, but individual, social, and cultural influences that disrupt a smooth relationship between severity of symptoms and social performance are sufficiently common and powerful to make it unwise to include social performance amongst the essential criteria of severity. The presence of dementia or mental retardation does not rule out the diagnosis of a treatable depressive episode, but communication difficulties are likely to make it necessary to rely more than usual for the diagnosis upon objectively observed somatic symptoms, such as psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite and weight, and sleep disturbance. Includes: single episodes of depression (without psychotic symptoms), psychogenic depression or reactive depression) F32.0 Mild Depressive Episode Diagnostic Guidelines Depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and increased fatiguability are usually regarded as the most typical symptoms of depression, and at least two of these, plus at least two of the other symptoms described above should usually be present for a definite diagnosis. None of the symptoms should be present to an intense degree. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. An individual with a mild depressive episode is usually distressed by the symptoms and has some difficulty in continuing with ordinary work and social activities, but will probably not cease to function completely. A fifth character may be used to specify the presence of the somatic syndrome: F32.00 Without somatic symptoms The criteria for mild depressive episode are fulfilled, and there are few or none of the somatic symptoms present. F32.01 With somatic symptoms The criteria for mild depressive episode are fulfilled, and four or more of the somatic symptoms are also present. (If only two or three somatic symptoms are present but they are unusually severe, use of this category may be justified.) F32.1 Moderate Depressive Episode Diagnostic Guidelines At least two of the three most typical symptoms noted for mild depressive episode should be present, plus at least three (and preferably four) of the other symptoms. Several symptoms are likely to be present to a marked degree, but this is not essential if a particularly wide variety of symptoms is present overall. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. An individual with a moderately severe depressive episode will usually have considerable difficulty in continuing with social, work or domestic activities. A fifth character may be used to specify the occurrence of somatic symptoms: F32.10 Without somatic symptoms The criteria for moderate depressive episode are fulfilled, and few if any of the somatic symptoms are present. F32.11 With somatic symptoms The criteria for moderate depressive episode are fulfilled, and four or more or the somatic symptoms are present. (If only two or three somatic symptoms are present but they are unusually severe, use of this category may be justified.) F32.2 Severe Depressive Episode Without Psychotic Symptoms In a severe depressive episode, the sufferer usually shows considerable distress or agitation, unless retardation is a marked feature. Loss of self-esteem or feelings of uselessness or guilt are likely to be prominent, and suicide is a distinct danger in particularly severe cases. It is presumed here that the somatic syndrome will almost always be present in a severe depressive episode. Diagnostic Guidelines All three of the typical symptoms noted for mild and moderate depressive episodes should be present, plus at least four other symptoms, some of which should be of severe intensity. However, if important symptoms such as agitation or retardation are marked, the patient may be unwilling or unable to describe many symptoms in detail. An overall grading of severe episode may still be justified in such instances. The depressive episode should usually last at least 2 weeks, but if the symptoms are particularly severe and of very rapid onset, it may be justified to make this diagnosis after less than 2 weeks. During a severe depressive episode it is very unlikely that the sufferer will be able to continue with social, work, or domestic activities, except to a very limited extent. This category should be used only for single episodes of severe depression without psychotic symptoms; for further episodes, a subcategory of recurrent depressive disorder should be used. Includes: single episodes of agitated depression, melancholia or vital depression without psychotic symptoms F32.3 Severe Depressive Episode With Psychotic Symptoms Diagnostic Guidelines A severe depressive episode which meets the criteria given for severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms and in which delusions, hallucinations, or depressive stupor are present. The delusions usually involve ideas of sin, poverty, or imminent disasters, responsibility for which may be assumed by the patient. Auditory or olfactory hallucinations are usually of defamatory or accusatory voices or of rotting filth or decomposing flesh. Severe psychomotor retardation may progress to stupor. If required, delusions or hallucinations may be specified as mood-congruent or mood-incongruent. Differential Diagnosis Depressive stupor must be differentiated from catatonic schizophrenia, from dissociative stupor, and from organic forms of stupor. This category should be used only for single episodes of severe depression with psychotic symptoms; for further episodes a subcategory of recurrent depressive disorder should be used. Includes: single episodes of major depression with psychotic symptoms, psychotic depression, psychogenic depressive psychosis, reactive depressive psychosis International Classification of Diseases (ICD), World Health Organization http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/",

      "When I was a preteen I was diagnosed with situational depression, and medicated with Prozac. Now I am seeing around the web it is identified as adjustment disorder. I had depressive symptoms for several months, even to the point of self harm or wanting to die. I was constantly sad, hopeless, guilty, self-hating, and lonely. The event in question that triggered this was a falling out with my best friend / crush, which evolved into thinking nobody liked me as I started separating from the rest of my friends. That was it. I broke down, over something as simple as THAT. I also struggled with accepting being gay and struggling with my religion. I often feel like I am immature or mentally weak for getting this upset over something so small. My therapist says I didn't choose to be depressed and it was a result of my emotional sensitivity. I feel like that's just another way of saying emotional immaturity. It happened a long time ago and I am no longer depressed, but I have residual symptoms of emotional numbness and self-loathing and I can't believe it traces back to something I don't even care about anymore. I feel like it's my fault, and that i am trivializing people with real problems, or depression and suicidal thoughts who either have it as a long term mental disorder or as a result of abusive or traumatic lives. I feel like I was just ungrateful and pathetic, as I had a very good life when suddenly I wanted to kill myself after one little thing went wrong, even when everything else was good. I was 12, perhaps I was just entitled and overdramatic? Does the fact I had situational depression mean that I am weak or that I'm trivializing serious issues by getting so depressed and suicidal over minor things? Is it my fault? I just wanna know.",

I was 12, perhaps I was just entitled and overdramatic? Hi Kip, I can tell you how it is for me. Overall I guess my life is okayish but I do have recurrent major deperssion and have to take meds probably forever to limit how far I fall when I have an episode. I have problems taking psych meds so I take the minimum effective dosage.  In theory this sounds good but what it means is that most of the time I'm just barely hanging on.  If one thing goes wrong I develop suicidal thoughts. Depression is an illness and not something any of us asks for. Depression doesn't care how wonderful your life is. Anyone can develop it. So no its not your fault. And I don't think responding the way you described to minor issues is any indication of how you would respond to a more serious one. If anything I think you would react more intensely to it, not less. For me the more serious the problem the further down the hole I fall.",

It was situational depression, not clinical, apparently.",
      "The only trivializing you’re doing is with all the insults you’re haphazardly throwing at yourself. The world is full of ---holes don’t be one to yourself. An adjustment disorder by definition is a disorder. Situational depression by definition is depression and a mental illness. Everyone naturally has emotional responses in your case your physical emotional response is dysfunctional. It’s still a disease and it kills people like any other."

      "Hi! This post is probably going to be TMI and very personal so just a warning in advance. I am an 18 year old girl who has recieved treatment for MDD in the past (started therapy off and on and was diagnosed when I was about 15) and when I turned 18 I started taking an SSRI (prozac) because I had a really bad episode. Before this, I would say my depression was off and on, and I would switch from feeling extremley depressed to feeling good. When I started taking medication, I felt a ton better in about 2 weeks since I first started taking it. I have been on 20mgs of prozac for about 5 months now and I feel like my life is out of control. I feel like I am way more outgoing than I have ever been and I also have a lot more energy than normal (sleeping for 4-6 hours and then feeling VERY awake the next day for days in a row) and this has led to some issues for me because I have felt very impulsive latley and like I dont have a filter anymore.I have been considering taking risks that woud get me in a lot of trouble if caught but I think I might do them because in my mind It seems like a good idea but when I tell people they act like I'm being super irrational. I have gotten 2 piercings and 2 tattoos in the last 5 months completley on a whim only thinking about doing it a few hours before.  I have spent over $400 in the last week and a half because I legit cannot stop spending money and I also have been talking to guys that are a lot older than me in a sexual context which I know is not smart but I was bored and thought it would be a fun idea. I am also very irrirable and have been snapping at people for doing small things which isn't that unusual but it has been a lot worse latley than before. I have had episodes like this in between my depressive episodes but they havent been this bad. Is there something wrong with me or is this just how SSRIs make people act?? I feel AMAZING and am having a great tim but I feel like my life is getting out of control and I dont want to see where this goes. I made a post in the past and people were saying it sounded like Bipolar but I honestly am terrified to bring that up to my doctor. Thank you guys so much for reading.",
      "Hi slizzy! Nobody here can diagnose you but based on what you described it could be bipolar.  If you are bipolar taking an SSRI without a mood stabilizer can be dangerous because it can make you hypomanic or manic and your behavior may become unsafe/unhealthy.  Telling your Dr. about what you are experiencing is not going to change who you are, it will just allow them to help you."

      "Hi All Hope all is well. I have been offered a new job with a new company. It's a conditional offer based on satisfactory DBS and references checks. Once all come back fine. I will be given a start and a copy of my contract. I have been informed my new employer my references has come back fine. They are only waiting back for my DBS. DBS can take time to come back. I have no concerns with my DBS as I know it will come back fine. I completed it a few weeks ago. So still waiting for it come back. I know once it reaches 60 days. You can esclate it. Which usually takes 1 day to complete. In my current role. I have to give one month's notice. A lot of people are leaving my team especially before Christmas. So I know management are having a hard time on tryin to get cover for it. I'm fairly certain they will try to get me to work Christmas especially as they won't want to come to cover it. I was thinkin of handing in my notice next week to escape working Christmas. I don't have a good working relationship with my management. So I don't feel obiliged to stick around and work Christmas for an employer who has messed me around a lot in the past. Things are getting bad with my current employer. To the point, depression has stepped in. One of my colleagues has advised me to hand in my notice before Christmas. Even though I don't have a start date and been offered a conditional offer. My colleague advised me to not worry about it as the only thing I wait for is the DBS which will come back fine. They advise me to resign. Enjoy Christmas and New Year with my family. To enquire about DBS if it comes to 60 days. Should I take the risk or do I wait?",
      "It's a risk, you can; Hand notice in and have a lovely relaxed Christmas and start your new position once the DBS check comes through. Hand notice in have a lovely relaxed Christmas and even though your DBS comes in fine they decide to not go through with the offer of employment. (can you afford to not be employed until something becomes available?) Or hold tight where you are until DBS comes through to be sure that the new position is yours. Unless the job you currently hold is causing you significant health issues I'd advise holding on until the new job offer is concrete.  Conditional can be many things."

      "I already have Major Depressive Disorder and a bunch of other problems that have keeping me from beng functional or productive lately. But recently, thing got much, much worse. My beloved cat is missing and is unlikely to return at this point based on time he's been missing and knowledge of his habits. My family and I have done all we can, walking and driving around looking for and calling for the cat, telling all the neighbors, posting lost cat photos around the neighborhood, etc. With my cat's age and timid nature taken into account, he is probably already met his end from the freezing cold nights recently or from the numerous stray dogs and cats in my apartment complex. I'm sure everyone fond of their pet(s), but for me this \"pet\" is family. I love him as much as my human family. Therefore, I have lost a family member. I cannot get out of bed, or shower, or eat properly, or think clearly, or hold conversations. I cry all day, unless I stay busy watching anime or reading something interesting. I cry at night when I'm trying to go to sleep and in the morning when I wake and remember that he is no longer here. In a sense, I am handling things much better than I would have 2 years ago, before I got on antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Normally I would resort to self-destructive acts like using drugs or injuring myself. I would end up in the all-too-familiar psych ward. However, with my therapist and my dad really being there for me, I don't think I'll do anything that desperate. I gave dad my knives and razors (and my credit card so I don't take out lots of cash for drugs). Unlike losses that have affected me in the past, I am neither actively suicidal, nor plagued with suicidal ideation all day every day. (That's how it used to be.) However, I still wish I was dead when I stop to think about it. I do not believe there is anything in the universe that can make this digusting life remotely \"worth it.\" I love my dad and my sisters, so I can't/won't kill myself. But that doesn't mean I know how the f*ck to live now. I stay in my room and I don't see anyone. I don't want to see anyone. I'm sleeping for long long amount of time to avoid the agony of being awake. I stay in bed. What am I supposed to do? I can't imagine trying to return to a productive lifestlye without that cat. He was my best friend and very much like my child. I'd like it if some people could respond and tell me what you think."

      "Hello everybody!! Just for context, I am an 18-year-old girl living in California. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with MDD and I was in therapy for about 6 months until my family's financial situation prevented me from going. I have had a few depressive episodes since then, but it's pretty off and on and I actually had a period of time last March-May that I felt the best I have ever felt. I was outgoing and felt optimistic about the future. That lasted for about a month, and then I had a really bad depressive episode and went on Prozac. Pretty much ever since then, I have felt like I am switching from being either really happy or really angry. I have read a lot about how anti-depressants make people not care about anything/ feel apathetic but  it's making me care about everything more than I ever have and I just want to shop and go out and change my whole life by buying myself new clothes and makeup and dying my hair. I don't know if this is normal or if I should bring it up to someone so any information or advice you have for me will help out a lot!! I am not really complaining because I have felt very productive and not like killing myself but I also don't feel like myself. Thank you!",
      "When you were seeing someone did anything ever come up about bipolar?  Sounds like you're swinging back and forth a bit.",
      "No, Bipolar did not come up during the time I was seeing someone. It was a while ago and this wasn't really going on at the time. I did stop going because I suddenly felt a lot better and my family's financial situation was not great and they didn't think I needed it anymore. I agree with what you are saying. I am just confused on how I can go from feeling so awful to feeling so great.",
      "Welcome to Psych Forums!!! I don't know if this is normal or if I should bring it up to someone so any information or advice you have for me will help out a lot!! What you describe is something almost exactly what I went through when I was 18 years old and was nearing high school graduation.  My \"ups and downs\" as I describe them, later, many years later, showed to be bipolar disorder type 1.  Bipolar I.  Doesn't mean you have it, though.

To describe how I would feel, I would feel really great, stupendous!  For about a week or longer, then I'd crash and I felt no energy and I didn't care if I graduated or not.  Then I'd feel great and I loved my friends and I just felt as if I loved EVERYONE!  That was hypomania and mania for me.  The euphoric kind.  There is also hypomania and mania in the form of dysphoric type where you are irritable.  I've had this too.  I am 43 now, and I didn't get diagnosed until I was 39, but I've had symptoms like I shared for years, off and on.  I never went in to get myself checked because I always went back to feeling normal, until...I had to go to the hospital because I became a danger to myself.  I was about 31.  I also took prozac at the highest dose for the depression and I ended up in a dangerous episode, called a mixed episode and well, it is something to share for another time because it's a REALLY long story. I would recommend you mention everything you shared here to your doctor, just so all your history is looked at.

And then I would be really talkative and wanting to go out and spend a ton of money and doing a ton of stuff. I had had periods like that before but when I started taking prozac it got worse. There is free counseling at my university so i might check that out. Thanks again.",

I've had episodes that perfectly mirror yours ... buying clothes, coloring my hair, etc.  They tend to last for a week or two and include a somewhat 'hopeful' outlook. In hindsight, they're completely unrealistic.  Mostly, my bipolar manifests as angry mania.  Although it doesn't happen constantly, when it does, I'm irrational and there's no talking me down. Anyway, I was originally put on Prozac back in 1995 for severe depression. Didn't notice changes while taking it but when I came off it a sharp increase in anger was highly evident.  Was put back on Prozac a few months ago.  It makes me sleep but doesn't seem do anything to my mood. I realize that meds effect everyone differently.  Just wanted to give my perspective."

      "I'm 42, and I've got no friends left. I was suicidal before, and had such a terrible mood and outlook on life, and I pushed everyone away.  I wanted to be alone, to hide under the covers, and to avoid life. Now I've still got my MDD, but I have it under control, with diet, exercise, and meds. I have a nice new home, and a great vehicle and a new job.  Everything is starting to get better. But I have nobody to share my joy with.  How do I make friends at this age? People are already setup in their patterns and routines of life at this point, and not many my age go about starting new friendships, or relationships.  I want friends and I want a woman, and I have neither, and it's making me slip back into a negative mood, despite my other successes. Thoughts? Advice? Help, please, I need ideas."

      "Three weeks ago I doubled my lexapro to 20mg. Starting early last weekend i realized I was kind of blunted emotionally. A lot anxiety went away and my mood \"sort of\" stabilized but that was it. I just feel kind of meh now. I\"m also very unmotivated. I spent all day on the internet/reddit rather than doing work that was due a week ago, a problem i've never had before this year (senior in college). However, I'm trying to start a relationship with an FWB. We've confessed feelings for each other and gone on two dates now. However, in the past week, I feel like my feelings and the spark have gone, on top of just feeling meh a lot of the time (although sometimes i do feel kind of happy or \"slightly better than satisfied\"). There are signs that that's not true, but it's still bothering me. The whole thing between us though has been super stressful because of the situation and because of my anxiety about feelings and about dating. I'm not sure if I've lost my feelings for her completely or mostly, because while there have been times where I was just completely meh, there are also times when I just feel good about her and times when I feel anxious about. And there have been other times, once or twice today, where I felt kinda happy and not empty at all really. Thoughts? I'm going to see my CBT therapist tomorrow and my psych tomorrow as well"

      "I feel hopeless, when I google for help none of it resonates or seems pertinent when I say hopeless its not because I dont think X or Y will happen, its because there is no X or Y. I'm 35, and I suppose objectively from there outs I have a decent/good life, but Im just sick of it all, life has nothing to offer that I want. very few things bring me any joy anymore, I've no dreams or ambitions. All the things I used to want either no longer interest me or outright disgust me. Its the weekend now and im probably going to spend it all inside alone reading and watching youtube. Is this it? this is my life now for the foreseeable? More and more I feel completed alienated and isolated from well everyone. when people are discussing things I just dont know what to say anymore because it all bores, angers or disgusts me. I'm not asking for anyone to give me hope but I would really welcome suggestions as to how to carry on with this, Im a teacher and my class today was just garbage because I just didn't care, about the lesson, my job, the students anything. It all seemed so...grotesque? I just want to know he best way to kill time until I die or this passes. please thank you",
      "Hi Doesntmatter (fitting nickname xD), Firstly, have you sought out professional help? Such acute apathy could be the result of a biological issue like a deficit in serotonin, and medication might be able to help. If you have not sought out this path I would urge you to consider it! I will describe the philosophy I have arrived at after my own struggles with meaning and purpose. However,  do keep in mind I do have a rather apathetic take on life, and do struggle with self harm and suicidal ideation on a regular basis, so TAKE ALL I SAID WITH A HEFTY AMOUNT OF SALT! Assuming your issues stem from a purely philosophical point (a far more interesting point to argue if I may say ), I would point you to Nietzsche's arguments on the Übermensch, in Thus Spoke Zarathustra , which I will now try to summarise and give my take on. Our experience of reality is necessarily grounded on a fundamental nihilism, as in, there is no deeper meaning or purpose that we can fundamentally grasp given our very limited set of ways with which to perceive the world and others. That, however, means not that we should give up on a meaning, and rather that we should define our own meaning. I would even argue that that which makes us truly human is this ability to update our own directives, and set our own path using this perceived free will we believe ourselves to possess. As such, I would argue that, based on your disillusionment with reality, you must have a core set of values with which to evaluate your life and reality, and merely find going after them pointless as it rewards you with no pleasure. However, it is also known (and the very basis of cognitive behaviour therapy if you wish to research empirical evidence on this phenomenon) that our thoughts shape and even generate our feelings. As such, I would argue that you should strive to live life as you see it to be good and righteous, not because it feels good, but because doing so will condition you into seeing it as pleasurable; in essence, training yourself to align what you what with what you want to want . Hope this tirade has been of some help, and best of luck! EDIT: I just realized I did not address your main request on \"best way to kill time until I die or this passes\", but I myself have found that no temporary distraction truly manages to keep the thoughts at bay (the main reason I self harm, as an extreme display of distraction-seeking behaviour I believe), and the only thing that has made it bearable has been the change in thought patterns I have described. Hope this helps!",
      "I hear ya. I feel like I'm just killing time, too. If you can, try to focus on something small. It'll take work to shut down the thoughts telling you it doesn't matter. I jump around to different things and it kinda helps. For awhile I was designing products on Zazzle. Most are duds, then I hit on one that continues to sell regularly and makes me $50/yr. I'm undergoing periodontal surgery next week, so I decided to focus on oral health. I researched a bunch to kill time. I bought a fluoride-free toothpaste with tea tree oil, a gum stimulator, different types of floss. I don't know how to explain it. It just helps to focus on something trivial and shut down the bigger existential crap. I also go down Pinterest or YouTube rabbit holes sometimes. On Pinterest, I have a board for dollhouses. I don't have a dollhouse and probably never will, but I am fascinated with miniatures, so I just look at them and pin away. I have another board of hamsters for some reason. On YouTube, I watch earwax removal videos. Can't explain it. You will love it or hate it. Dr Rhys Barber from Audiology Associates is the best. If anyone were to ask about my hobbies, these are not things I would tell them! But whatever, they hold my attention for awhile. I do enjoy talking to people sometimes. I started forcing myself to go to a coffee shop regularly. I read a book or do a crossword, play on my phone. It's a good way to get out without having to interact. If you decide you do want to interact, you can. Most people hanging out at a coffee shop are relaxed and friendly. Also, if you haven't already, read \"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff\". It sounds counter-productive to someone who already doesn't care, but I found it actually altered my negative thinking over time. Anyway, those are my thoughts and ideas, for what it's worth."

      "I am unable to control my crying. I don't think there are medications for this. The depression is just so severe, I am not thinking anything specific when I cry, I just cry, long and hard and often. This is frightening, does anyone have any ideas. Crying wasn't a part of my past depressive episodes, this is new and scary. Thank you.",
      "When we're talking serious depression- isn't that more of a numbness?  And crying means you're feeling something, then?  I've known people who felt nothing, not even sadness.  Looked at it that way, crying at least means you're feeling... not trying to minimise it, just sayin'.  If sadness is possible, then other emotions may be. I know I go thru periods where I'm either weepy, or have a very low trigger for being teary-eyed.  But long, hard, good cries, I haven't really had the capability for, for some time.",
      "Tears can be a sign of healing and are a stress relief. It is when you can't cry but really need to, is a problem as well. Are you currently seeing a therapist for depression? This may be a good thing to check, just to make sure that nothing else is going on physically or mentally. Best of luck to you.",
      "What Wally said.  I think I'd worry more about not being able to cry, than crying a lot.  Back in the day, I used to be able to have really good, epic, give-you-a-headache cries.  And it'd let a lot of stuff out.  After my momma died, I... was too busy when it happened, to do more than weep a little.  Or so I thought.  Then some time after, it occurred to me... I seemed unable to have those good cries any more.  I stay weepy a lot, but a good, till-your-eyes-ache cry?  I've lost the ability.  And I feel as if I've lost something important, that something has died inside.  I think it's depression that's crept up on me.  I can't think of any other reason a person would lose the ability to have a good old fashioned cry.  I envy the ability to cry one's eyes out. Not saying you're in a good place, to be having hard cries frequently.  But I think it is a sign of hope, in its own way.  I've known people here who were completely flat, no emotion, no feeling, nothing.  That is a scary place.  I'm grateful that I'm weepy sometimes, as well as still feel some situational happiness.",
      "Thank you Snaga and Wally for responding. I understand what you are saying. I have had the inability to cry experience. I thought maybe someone might have experienced what is happening now, my crying too often and for too long for no reason....meaning nothing in particular precedes it.",
      "Regrettably I don't know the link, but I remember seeing a comic strip, the kind that's crudely drawn (probably intentionally) about someone with depression finally coming out of it, and I seem to recall negative emotions being the first to return?  Like anger, or sadness.  And they were like that seems bad, but it's feeling something, when they weren't, before.  And then the good things started returning, too."

      "i was initially gonna post this thread in the schizotypal or personality disorder threads but i thought that maybe i might have more people viewing the post here and / or get better answers as i haven't had much luck in the personality disorder forums in general. so i just made the title on the differences between detachment vs inhibition vs psychomotor retardation, i wanted to see what anyone's take is on this as i haven't been able to find a clear definition for detachment and / or differentiating it with inhibition. i added psychomotor retardation because it's something that can be manifested as a commorbid problem with the two and / or be caused by the two, although there are more things to be added. the last time i was speaking with my psychologist, i mentioned to her on one of my experiences in childhood in 5th or 6th grade, i was in a basketball game and we were short a point or two i believe, and i had intercepted the ball towards the ending but couldn't follow through because i became \"over-excited\" or \"over-stimulated\" or \"overwhelmed\" by the audience in the background chanting for me. this caused me to stumble and have a \"moment\" where instead of being serious, i became the complete opposite and this is where i stumbled by dribbling the ball to the right, away from the direction of hoop to which i needed to score on ( i intercepted around the half court line or so ), and at the same time i was smiling as if i was high or something and it took some second or two to recaliberate from that and try to score but i was a bit late as one defender already was too ahead of me and kind of just throw the ball in a half assed manner for a layup and it missed. so i was just wondering if anyone has ever experienced this and / or what could be the name or description to give to it, this of course was at a very young age and developmentally i am different now which is why i wrote the whole detachment vs inhibition vs psychomotor retardation aspect because i noticed as i got older, i would use one of these because i felt off and out of place, and essentially, that formed my personality or part of my personality but it still doesn't explain what is what exactly and the causes. my psychologist mentioned that the basketball experience i had is like the opposite end of psychomotor retardation, so instead of just being frozen in awkwardness and social clumsiness, you release those feelings overtly i suppose? btw i wanted to include that i have a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder and major depressive disorder, i relate to both, however, often i question whether my stpd is really explained by another condition such as sluggish cognitive tempo or at least commorbid with it, russell barkley's recent presentation showed that at least 25 percent of sct people were already diagnosed with depression in the most recent national survey he did and as someone who has followed his research, i have to say, that this was pretty important to me. i have a hard time accepting the schizotypal diagnosis because i feel like a lot of things people might see in me are confused as schizotypal symptoms such as not \"Getting things\" or seeing things in a different way, the only things i sometimes feel like i have is some of the negative symptoms described by katie morton in the what is psychosis video she has, but i think those were not psychosis but part of depression, it's confusing. i sometimes may feel weird or strange, but it isn't like i believe in some superficial or random thing, i don't get any hallucinations, delusions or any of that stuff, but sometimes i may isolate myself more and / or get this scary dreadful feeling, but it's not empty / depressed feeling, it's a agitating or stressful feeling, like my brain is going haywire and i can't seem to pinpoint what it is i am feeling or what's going on. this can happen too or feel similar when my digestion system acts up as usual, but more specifically at night when i have to go to sleep, it can be very stressful because i have to let my body do what it does and it can be very irritating not knowing what it is either, i attribute it to a combination of traumatic / emotional aspects and physical / biological problems like gut / brain connection, food intolerances and sensitivities, etc. with the whole depression or possibly psychosis related end, i can stuff myself food a lot which i may end up getting full and then i may skip a meal or not each as much due to a myriad of reasons, such as it getting to late, being full and simply not having much of an appetite. i was hoping someone can relate, one example of the psychomotor retardation case is when i was at a family friends' house, it was me, my brother, my cousin, his cousin, and the family friend's daughter, we were playing monopoly or some board game, they were playing music time from time, and then there was a specific song that they put, after this stimulus, i immediately became uncomfortable from the song and the way it sounded while being with other people in the social environment. i am not sure if i was already participating in the board games we were playing but after the song stimulus part, i slowly crawled underneath a nearby table and just sort of layed there awkwardly, at one point, one of them asked me if i was ok or something and i think i was like yeh, im ok, and it was just very uncomfortably for me the entire time. also in most of my grade school years, from early puberty ( age 10-11 or so ) till now still, ( 25 years old now ), i would often put my head down in class for up to long periods because of being overwhelmed emotionally or feeling awkward / clumsy / uncomfortable from the social environment, so much that it caused neck or back pain, and i attribute this to part of my depression cause, like putting myself in stress positions most of my life because of the environment being a problem. interestingly, Russell Barkley's slide on sct PERFECTLY explained what i felt like my entire life and growing up, the slide mentions they may escape situations out of discomfort or related issues, and that's exactly what i wrote about and experienced.",
      "Psychomotor retardation is the slowing of thoughts and reduction in movements. For example, a person experiencing this might speak slowly, walk slowly, or remain motionless for long periods before they are able to will themselves to move.

Having it feels like your mind and body are drifting off into a deep sleep. Your breathing is slowed, your mind is blank and sleepy, your body seems glued to your chair, and the idea of getting up and moving feels far away and inaccessible.

      "I feel like I faked my depression all along. I started suspecting it when I was 11- I was coming to terms with my sexual identity and lost some personal friendships which left me feeling lonely, deeply hurting, hating myself, isolated, and suicidal. And my dad was narcissistic, that too. I thought it would go away normally but it lasted for weeks. I self-diagnosed using online symptom checkers before I got my official diagnosis for situational depression a few months later. It hurt a lot. I didn't want to have it. Yet at the same time I handled it so poorly. I wallowed in self pity. I had a huge victim mentality, sometimes I blamed others for all my problems, and then other times blamed myself for everything. I whined and complained a lot, one could say the things I said sounded like what an emo kid would. I had attention-seeking tendencies, I was not vocal about the things I was going through but I always had a mopey face on, hoping someone would notice I was hurting and come to show me love, care, and affection. If anyone did I usually turned them away though. Sometimes my attention seeking was dramatic though, such as asking my classmates how they would feel if I was gone. Or acting like an overall downer and pessimist in front of my peers. A lot of my pain was self-inflicted. I jumped to conclusions, and often unconsciously pushed myself to feel worse as a form of self-sabotage, or simply because I was getting so used to my bad feelings they became a \"blanket\" of sorts and I was scared to get leave. I wanted to get better but I purposely hindered my recovery, finding new reasons to feel upset about something. It felt like it was becoming part of my identity. Bottom line, I did a lot of things to myself a me caused my own problems. I never listened to advice or tried to change things. I plunged myself deeper. I was still capable of feeling joy and soothing myself but I didn't take advantage of it. I used to cut after I saw others doing it. It was a form of self-punishment but also it was a way of showing how I felt on the outside, and I took some sort of sick pride in them, not wanting them to heal. (They're healed now and I'm thankful.) But I also hid them, because I was scared of getting in trouble. I didn't want anyone to know. I used to hang out with these really toxic girls who were open about their issues. Their behaviors rubbed off on me and I used to tag about how long my scars lasted. I feel sick looking back on it. I wanted to kill myself but I was too cowardly to. The worst I ever done was attempt to choke myself to death with a scarf. Petty I know. And I actually considered that an attempt knowing it would fail. Yuck. I feel like I overplayed my symptoms, my sleeping and fatigue wasn't as bad as I thought it was, nor was my concentration or weight. I also used to think I had panic attacks, but now after actually having them they are much worse than I imagined them to be. I used to think that I needed someone to save me from the way I was feeling. There was this one person who had depression much worse than me but sacrificed their time to help me with mine. I deeply idolized them and craved for their love and affection and attention specifically. I used to vent about my problems all the time, I was very dependent on them, the conversation was always about me and I never helped them out with their problems because I was scared of triggering them. But even when they brought it up, somehow it always went back to me. I was so selfish/-absorbed/-centered and whiny that eventually I drove them away. I used to have a secret vent account. Not for attention, just to drop my baggage. I had a picture of my scars (not bloody) not for attention, but as a vent as well. I posted a lot of depression quotes because I related to them and it made me feel better in a way, but it wasn't exactly healthy. Sometimes I'm scared I was just romanticizing though. I had another account on a drawing app (separate from my personal social media) where I'd make a post whenever I felt sad and needed help and consolation. I made a lot of people worried about me. Eventually I cried wolf so many times nobody helped anymore. I can't recall, but I think someone accused me of faking or seeking attention once. The first phase of my depression was a huge pity party, I never tried to change my outlook for the better. Not even my birthday party or Christmas could make me feel better. I was so selfish and bratty. It was an emotional, teary-eyed roller coaster with so, so much crying and feeling misunderstood. That was until I was 12 and moved to a new school for a fresh start. Suddenly, like a light switch, my emotions went numb. My ability to physiologically feel positive feelings like joy or pleasure at all diminished. I felt empty and disconnected from my body, sense of self, and surroundings. Since then I've been in limbo, and time felt like it was passing too fast. Certain people are stuck in my brain. And my emotions are blunted. And the self-deprecating thoughts I used to hammer into my head became core beliefs, my truth, not just a way of emotional self-harm. The zest of life is overall hard to connect with again. And, I just don't talk to people about how I feel anymore. I'm not sure if it's better or worse than what I had. But it makes me wonder if someone can fake depression so hard that they actually get it. Because I really miss my positive feelings now, and I wish I could've taken advantage of them when I still had them. Sometimes I wonder if I don't get diagnosed and just let my emotions play out normally, maybe it would have gone away. But I don't know. I feel like it's my fault I'm still here today. And I hate myself for it. I brought this all on myself. I destroyed everything. I told my therapist I felt like I was faking, and brought up all the evidence I had against myself. He confirmed that I did have a huge victim mentality, and that my depression was situational not clinical, but he also said with a smile, \"your pain was real, and it was hard for you. You are not a faker, fraud or a liar. Sorry, I'm not going to tell you that. You aren't faking.\" I just have a hard time trusting and believing him. I feel like if my depression is fake, that invalidates all the hurt and struggle to get better I've had over the years. That all of this was for nothing. And that I was making a mockery of real depressed people. And that I was a bad person. I'm only a teen but sometimes I'm really concerned I might've just had BPD or facticious disorder all long, and this was a misdiagnosis. The dramatic-ness and attention seeking of it, the self-victimization, the deep-seated self-loathing, the self-absorption, the fact it was caused by relationship and abandonment problems, it all seems to add up. And I feel kinda awful. I feel that the fact I'm even looking for validation one her just proves that I'm fake. But I wonder if anyone else feels the same way, and how maybe I can trust the words of my therapist without constantly doubting.",
      "Oh gosh sweetie I sometimes feel as if I'm faking it, too.  I'm sure a lot of others have, as well.  I mean... it's like we know better, and it seems as if we'd just 'snap out of it', I mean.... yeah.  Yeah I feel like a fraud.  Or that I hang onto my feelings of hopelessness and my anxieties, and won't do anything about them.  When it should be so easy to, right?  Or not...  I feel as if I refuse to get better, or do anything to get better.  Yeah I accuse myself of it being my own fault, all the time. So maybe you have a victim mentality, but I think you should trust your therapist, when they won't hand you the faking it card.  I mean, think of it this way- why would a well adjusted person who wasn't messed up, fake it?  They wouldn't want to.  If I were a normie, I wouldn't be the messed up thing I am.  Wouldn't want to be, wouldn't understand it, wouldn't be it.  Meh.  The very act of exaggerating things- if that's what you did- is itself, to me, proof that there's something real going on, sweetie.  I'm sure the therapist is thinking along those lines. And well, just a note on your social alt media where people stopped responding... sure, some of it may have been accusations of crying wolf, but... I mean, we see it here.  If someone is at a stuck place, people run out of things to say.  It's not like I don't want someone to get better, or that I stopped caring- but I (and everyone else) can only say the same thing so many different ways, then we run out of steam.  For a while, at least.  But it's not the same as no longer caring.",
      "^^^ Thanks. It helps.",
      "I legit used it as a crutch though. I projected my pain into a mopey expression and hoped someone would notice or care, and when someone did care, I used and (unintentionally) manipulated them to get love and affection. I didn't love myself and felt like I couldn't help myself, so I looked at other people to save me and wash away my problems when it was me who was perpetrating all my own pain. That's not something a depressed person does. Depressed people don't like talking about their condition...I talked about mine all the time, whether it be my family, internet friends, or this one real life friend who I dragged down with me. Depressed people do anything in their power to change things. I sought out help but I didn't use any of it to my advantage, instead choosing to victimize myself and suffer.",
      "I'm depressed, and while I don't go parading it, doing something about it, well... no, not really. A quick look at your  posting history, two stand out.  BPD and OCD.  Sweetie, I have borderline traits.  And I'm OCD.  Don't know about you, but I'm pretty messed up.... you don't think you couldn't be overthinking this a wee bit, do you?   Don't get me wrong- I'm not trying to make excuses for bad behaviour.  But like, pwBPD think and do things they know better, if they're fairly self-aware.  pwOCD go round and round with obsessions that on some level, they know better, if they're likewise clear-headed enough to see what they're doing.   Just because you know how you behaved, doesn't mean you sat down and calmly planned it out.  I see the $#%^ I do all the time, and still do them.  Because I have a mental illness... it's not an excuse, mind you, just an explanation.  You can have been manipulative with emotions, etc., and still not been able to help yourself from doing it at the time.  Now that you're aware, painfully so, it seems, then try to do better!  But you can only beat yourself up so much, for the past, hon.  I do believe that beating ourselves up over things that are over and done and can't be undone, is pointless.  Trying not to be those things again (and I have many regrets), is the only way to atone.  But we have to forgive ourselves, to move forward.",
      "Well, I haven't been diagnosed with BPD or OCD, they're only suspicions, so I can't know for sure if I really have them. But I thank you for your help and kind words anyway. It does help.",
      "I haven't been Dx'd either, but only a dummy would say I didn't have OCD- as for the other, I think I have traits, nothing more.  Like you, it's a suspicion."

I’m aware this is what the illness is doing to me but it’s incredibly difficult and feels very real. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. i can somewhat relate in the sense that the therapists / or mental health specialists i see, they don't normally give good information or feedback, and even if they do, they are only answering my own questions and repeating what i already know, yes, time is a limiting factor a lot. i was gonna ask how long have you been seeing mental health specialists? you mentioned the importance of seeing a psychiatrist, it would seem you haven't spent much in the mental health support field? well, the answer to the psychiatrist part is that it depends, normally psychiatrists only prescribe medication and you can talk a bit on symptoms, etc, but i wouldn't necessarily rush to a psychiatrist unless you have some sort of tact, it's easy to fall into their \"trap\" or get brainwashed or w.e, i suffered a lot from side effects and abuse from them because they clearly didn't understand my problems and condition, one medication in particular they prescribed which was latuda had sent me to the hospital from it's near deadly side effects and the way the medication simply worked, ( which never should have been prescribed to me, stupid psychiatrist , and poor innocent me not knowing what else to do with my depression and conditions ) currently, i do not take any psychiatric medications myself nor would i want to, i am simply living / existing with my conditions as they are ( major depression being one of them ) and regularly see my psychologist every week and follow up with other stuff, hopefully finding some more safer or natural supplement or homeopathic solution in the future, but really, for your diagnosis, you should be seeing a mental health specialist, particularly a licensed psychologist, of course, you can have good or bad therapists, regardless of background or credentials. have you done any psychologist testing? iq test, etc? all of these are important in seeing what route or treatment would work best for you / how well you can benefit, etc. overall, i would say to first do all you can with mental health specialists, take any psychological testing, explain yourself to the best you can, please try to be accurate, and if there is something you can't talk about in depth or it's too personal, then let them KNOW! it's important to have all these details informed."

      "I was diagnosed with dysthymia. I've been on Lexapro for exactly 30 days. 5mg first 2 weeks and 10mg last 2 weeks. First 2 weeks were great and I felt I was becoming myself again. But these last 2 weeks I have lost motivation. Now I have no desire to do anything not even the go to the gym. I'm also having a lot of mood shifts. I was put on seroquel to take at night because lexapro made me have insomnia but I just don't feel like the Lexapro is working anymore and I'm thinking of going off it. Should I give it more time or drop it?",
      "With most antidepressants its hard to know if they will work for you until you have been on them for 6 weeks at the current dosage. Unfortunately its a bit of a guessing game as to which med will work for each individual so it may take time to find one that works and that you can also tolerate the side effects. As for why it seemed to work better the first two weeks it could have been you were just having 2 good weeks with or without meds anyway.  The other possibility is that Lexapro works better for you at the lower dosage.  Some people are sensitive to psych meds (I am) and respond well at low dosages."

Still can’t throw off my depression ☹️ Just wondering if anybody has had experience of combining antidepressants and antipsychotics in the treatment of MDD? After running through most possible options for antidepressants, I’m now on 45mg of mirtazipine, 50mg of quetipine and 200mg pregabalin (for pain as well as anxiety). My doctor seems optimistic that the quietiapine will help the mirtazipine to work...I can’t say I agree but optimism is not something I often feel.

      "Hi!, I have suffered from depression since i was 12 years old and i have tried almost every medicine there is for it and nothing seems to work.. I have missed so much school, lost friends.. all of that stuff.. But now to the problem, when i first got depressed i started to daydream. At first it was quite innocent stuff you know, my favorite actor came to my school and i got super popular hehe things like that.. But it soon developed to something much more complicated and i remember it was that summer (2006) that i really started daydream all the time i was on our trampoline in the garden, jumping and listening to music.. I dreamed that i was a big star and everybody wanted me and then i dreamed i had a boyfriend and things like that i don't remember it too vividly.. Since then i have been daydreaming all the time, the only time im not daydreaming is when i have a conversation with someone else.. Otherwise it is constantly and i just want it to stop. I have over the years had different daydreams they have all been about me imagining that i am a movie star and i always have a boyfriend/husband. Sometimes children. Since about 2010 i have had the same daydreams which is me, the exact person i am today only a 1000 times better. I am a successful filmmaker and movie star, I write all my own films, I star in them, I pretend that it is a few years in the future so i am maybe 20, 21 (the older i get the older me in this fantasy gets.) The worst thing about my daydreaming is that it is always involving real people who are famous (not always i am currently pretending a girl who runs a blog is my best friend) And i know these people are real but i get so attached to them and i feel so creepy when i think about it.  It's always a guy i get obssessed with and i pretend we get together and eventually get married. It tend to change every 6 months to a year.. what changes is usually if i read that the guy is in a relationship and then i have to find someone new.. But it's not always a guy sometimes it's just someone i see in an interview or in a film and i pretend they are my friends.. It's not always good tho in these fantasies i do imagine that i am depressed and even tho i am so famous and successful and beautiful and talented i am depressed at times and i have several time tried to kill myself in these fantasies (I have tried once in real life.) And i take a bunch of drugs and i am super miserable sometimes.. This is affecting my life so much to the point where i dont know what to do, i have so often over the years tried out different schools and activities to get out of depression but i just wanna go home to my room and daydream, I have one friend and whenever i am with her i just wish she was like my friends in my daydream. But she is not. I don't like her so much but she is all i got. This is ruining my life. But i don't know how to stop. I am going to a shrink tomorrow and i am going to try to tell her. I have been going to her for a few weeks and she is fantastic. So a few questions; does anyone else have this problem? Is this maldaptive daydreaming? What can i do to stop it?",
      "I call it my unreality where I escape to and hang out in for a good part of the day everyday. I sit or lay down where ever I am at and daydream and become lost in thought and shut off from the world for a while. I have few friends (close ones atleast) and my grades in school were nearly straight E's from about 4th grade until graduation. It can change for me. Sometimes it people I know, other times its people I have seen like a character in a movie or an actor and other times I make them up or its just me doing things myself. If its with another person its usually a man and its obsessive. I get what your saying about the constant day dreaming and its effect on your life. Not dx'd with anything so idk about depression or if its anything really related but I could see it being so. Never heard of maladaptive day dreaming. Is that an actual thing or are you just asking for a way to describe it? All I can say to stop it is try and focus on what's happening around you and don't give yourself too long to stop and shut down and go into the fantasy world. Try and keep it to only thinking about it during the evening when your laying down to sleep and no other time during the day. It might make it easier as long as you allow yourself the time. Its like a diet. If you say no sweets and don't allow yourself any then its all you think about and crave so you should allow yourself tiny portions or rewards to eliminate the craving and keep under control. Post how it went at the shrinks? Hope it went well and you're okay.",
      "Hon, that definitely sounds like Maladaptive Daydreaming. Here is a website with more information about it: http://daydreamingdisorder.webs.com/",
      "Is this similar to what the protagonist goes through in 'A beautiful mind'?",
      "i would suggest getting into buddhism and a real effort to practice meditation, works like CBT. you need to focus on what is real in the present moment and try to still your mind. also have you tried SNRIs? that in combination with a stimulant works well for me (aside from side effects).. used to be more inside my head.

      "Hey everyone, So I've come across some posts on here as well as other sites about sexual experimenting between siblings and cousins. I wanted to share my own experience and what I’m about to write is the worst regret of my life and I’m starting to feel suicidal and depressed as a result. I'm 27 years old now so this happened 10 + years ago I myself had my own embarrassing and shameful experience when I was a very young teen with my younger brother too (both males, approx. 5 yrs apart). As kids we would play with each other all the time like we were attached at the hip. Despite the fighting, we’d love each other’s company. Long story short we were wrestling or playing around one day and somehow I ended up starting this game where I dry humped/rubbed my body against his in somewhat of a sexual way, plus a little touching/groping. What worries me is that I was the one who initiated it. He did consent but was probably too young to understand what was going on. It only happened once or twice and then the urges went away and only after it happened is when I started to realize it was awkward. We're both straight and never been attracted to the same sex but for some reason this happened. The last time it happened he got a little bothered by it so that made me realize that I should stop. Ever since then I've been regretting it so much and feel really depressed about the situation. Over the years its been coming back slowly to haunt me more and more. Nothing but shame, regret and disgust. Sometimes suicidal thoughts come to me as well. I hate myself so much for it and for while I convinced myself that I was some sort of monster that sexually abused his brother. I’ve been a good person my whole life to everyone I know and I always treat people with the most empathy and sympathy. This once incident is the one thing where I wish I had done different. I honestly don't know what prompted me to do this but at that age I probably wanted to know what being sexual/having sex felt like due to puberty and hormones, yet I was never sexually attracted to my brother. I wasn't even watching porn or masturbating at that age yet and I didn't even know what masturbating was (very socially underdeveloped and sheltered at that age). I'm guessing serious urges through puberty, experimentation, curiosity and lack of control of hormones. My brother and I were very close, and always around each other playing physically so that might have also led to doing it with him rather then anyone else. Now, I don't remember physically forcing him or threatening him in any way and there was no malicious intent behind it but I get these “what if” thoughts that I maybe might persuaded him in a playful way but even that is a very vague fuzzy memory which worries me. Looking back at it I wish I never did it but at the time I guess wasn’t able to fully understand the “rights” and “wrongs” of sexuality and the potential consequences. Now I've heard this kind of stuff is somewhat common amongst siblings at a very young age but I'm a little concerned and worried because technically I was not a 'child' anymore. I could have technically been considered a young 'teenager' at the age (can't remember due to how long ago it was). I think I was maybe 14-15yrs of age. My therapist said that this stuff is somewhat common and that although I wasn't a child, mentally and cognitively I was still acting as a kid. Also, because my parents were extremely overprotective, sheltering and neglecting that that could have been another factor in my delayed development. I also rarely had friends and I was very attached to my brother which could have brought us closer to age in terms of development. The regret is absolutely terrible and it feels like a completely different person that has done this when I was that age. I’ve never molested, sexually abused, harassed or touched any child or even had the thought of doing such things for that manner. Just thinking about it from other people sickens me My questions are: 1) Is this considered abuse or experimentation ? 2) How do I cope with this depression and guilt in the best manner ? 3) Should I bring it up with my brother to apologize and to see if I can help him if he is negatively affected by it ? Or will that do more harm then good ? Thanks in advance for any insight you guys might have. I appreciate it !",
      "DaSilva1727 wrote: 1) Is this considered abuse or experimentation ? This is obviously just my opinion, but I'd say experimentation.  Based on how you describe your interactions with your brother it doesn't seem like you knew what you were doing.  Also you describe a childhood isolated from other potential friends and mostly had just your brother.  (I basically had no real friends my age until I was 11 yrs so I get what that was like.)  You don't fully develop to an age appropriate social level because of it. DaSilva1727 wrote: 2) How do I cope with this depression and guilt in the best manner ? I don't think I can help you with this one.  I am dx'ed with depression, but mine has permanent  biological component to it that has to be controlled with meds.  I have read other posts on this board from people who have had suicidal thoughts because of being part of a perceived inappropriate relationships.  You wrote that you have talked to your therapist about this.  I guess I'm surprised they weren't able to help you more. Are you still seeing this therapist?  Were you prescribed any medication to help you with your suicidal thoughts?

I wouldn't say anything.  You are digging up the past and you don't know how that may play out.  Your brother may have completely forgotten about it or maybe he remembers it but isn't concerned about it. If he ever comes to you about it that a completely different situation, but until that happens you - and your brother - are likely better off if you deal with this on your own without involving him.",
      "Hi Shattered Mind, Thank you very much for your input and advice I do appreciate it. Currently my therapist doesn't recommend any medication nor did she advise me to take any but then again I never asked as well. I'm a little iffy about it but maybe I'll look into it if it gets worse down the line. I still see her once a week or every two weeks and it does help a lot. Im beginning to depend on it but if changes the way I think and helps out then I'll keep going until things change. I also agree with your last comment, and so many other people have as well. If he's forgotten about it then its best to leave it in the past and not drag up any unwanted feelings and risk re-colouring the event as a \"traumatizing\" experience. I don't think my brother would understand fully the concept of siblings doing this and he might get the \"OMG I've been molested\" thoughts. The only thing I'm worried about is the memories being repressed in his mind and then the potential of the memories coming up later on in life where they begin to bother him and impact him negatively. But until then I need to find ways to deal with the feelings on my own and not be selfish to bring him into it",

      "I have been working in my current job for two years now. I left for two months to start a new job. However, I found the new job – it was a very toxic environment. Management talking about other staffs confidentiality in the office. Gossiping about others. I was still covering overtime shifts for my old workplace via going over my work hours resulting into working 58 hours per week. Which clearly showed I was dedicated to my old workplace. Two months into the new job. So I returned back to my old job. The new job's management are working closely with my old management. So the link is there. However, since I have returned back to my old job. I have found my old management have changed and in fact I have experienced workplace bullying. On my first week of returning back to my old job. I noticed my Team Leader was always on the phone having conversations with the manager of the project that I just left. Some of these conversations were outside away from me. My current Team Leader chose to put me on weekends working with another colleague whom I don't get on well with. So I informed I was feeling anxious about this and we met for a meeting. I was absolutely shocked because what I turned to her for support and instead experienced in that meeting – was bullying. It clearly showed the bitterness and anger that was coming from the manager of the project that I just left from. Some of the bullying I experienced in the meeting: “That I should speak to my GP and seek counselling” after I explained that I was feeling anxious about working with another member of staff on weekends and working alone on same shifts as well after I explained and provided examples on why I was feeling uncomfortable working with the other staff” “Team Leader finds me patronizing towards another member of staff ” “I jump from job to job too quickly” “Why didn’t I notify the team leader first before the service manager on wanting to apply for the job that I just left” “Team Leader is very surprised to see me come back to the project. Most people get at least 18 to 24 months experience and then move on. I’m coming up to being here for two years now. Team Leader is very surprised to see me back here. When I left, it was time for me to move on. What can I develop in the job now that I have returned” “I should move on to gain further different experience within other services within the work company” Team Leader informed me that she and another member of staff had agreed tension between I and previous SW had disappeared after I left the service” “I was using the old office at lot when working under the new service instead of working at the new office” A week later I sent an email on what happened and copied her manager above her into it. I requested on why she said those things. She replied back saying she will talk to me in Supervision. This was four weeks ago. In conclusion, I came to her seeking support as my Team Leader but since the meeting, I have felt low, intimidated and unwanted on the team. The manager above her never replied nor did anything about it. A week later, I requested via email to meet with my manager for Supervision. Again I copied in her manager so she is aware of it. We currently had two weeks remaining of the rota. The reply I got back was – she is waiting for the September rota to come out as she and I won't be seeing much of each other during the next two weeks. I looked at her diary and she has nothing planned. There is plenty of time to meet with me. She has met with other staffs for supervision and I'm the only person who she hasn't met with. Again the manager above her has seen my requests and has done nothing. My Team Leader has been avoiding me as much as possible. I have maintained my professionalism and doing my job. I have joined unison but they say they can't offer advice as it's an on-going issue which started before I joined. The meeting took place on 13/08/18. I have requested for a follow up meeting. I have been denied and ignored. The manager above her has done nothing. No means of trying to resolve this issue. I feel I have done a lot to help the service when they needed it. Now I won't do any more cover and I'm looking for another job. But then I feel why should I leave when I fought so hard for the project. Anyone got any advice please?",
      "Is there a Human Resources person or dept where you are? Our workplace has a zero-tolerance for any kind of harassment. Even if it doesn't happen to me personally, if I see something, I am expected to say something without fear of retaliation. Best of luck to you."

      "For crying out loud, I've escaped depression, or have, given that I'm now emotionallly numb? I don't feel things viscerally, anymore, and am joyless and ambitionless, if calm. I've tried running meditation, and karate, but don't know if there's any drug that might unclog me; is there?  Is there even a technical term for this?",
      "Numbing is a variant or phase of depression, not an escape from it. And my Wellbutrin sure as hell made it tough to be numb!",
      "rustybrain wrote: Numbing is a variant or phase of depression, not an escape from it. And my Wellbutrin sure as hell made it tough to be numb! I tried it; didn't help a lick.  WHere might I learn about this phase of depression, though?  It seems obscure in the literature, compred to the others, and it's affecting my creativity. I don't quite know how to describe it, though; I unknowingly, it seems, repressed my feelings while battling massive anger and depression, but while the rage and depression have totally evaporated, well, the numbness has not; ideas used to be bursting out my skull, but no more; I used to be really enthusiastic, but I just don't feel it, and you're talking who takes regular karate, and has tried unsuccessfully for that runner's high.  I used to get it, but no more. (Drugs, far as I can tell, have had no discernible impact getting me into, or out of, this state, either.) I'm stuck, and I don't know how to escape, despite deep breathing for over a full hour for a year-and-a-half.  I'm short of ideas, and desperate.",
      "I'm surprised dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibition didn't do anything. How long were you on it? I'm not a psychiatrist, of course, and I guess I'm mostly going off of my experience. Anyway, it sounds like anhedonia. Depression can have many faces - the same depression in the same person, even. Anhedonia was a big part of my depression and I think it's a big part for most people. What was your depression like before this?",
      "Anhedonia; I'll look it up. As for my depression before this, well, it was copious amounts of rage (past the pain threshold) and fear, physical exhaustion, and an inability to concentrate, and uncontrollable erections.  I don't know what I d call it, though. As for inhibitors, I tried large dosages for something like three weeks.  Too short?",
      "It took six weeks to kick in for me, which I think is pretty standard. I think anhedonia is actually a more common symptom of depression than rage, hypersexuality, fear, difficulty concentrating, etc. That sounds very \"up.\" Have you considered the possibility that you might have something cyclic?",
      "Hey there, let me see if i can help. Couple of quick questions: 1.) How do you feel in the mornings, as opposed to how you feel in the evenings? 2.) What type of inhibitors were you prescribed? There are different kinds, and some people are inherently immune to some types (if unsure, you can list the medications you took, and i can classify them). Please include dosages, time of day taken, how often they were taken daily, and other medications you were/are on. 3.) Depression is often present with some other types of mental disorders, such as ADHD and Anxiety Disorders. Have these ever been mentioned to you, and were you screened for them? 4.) What has been your results in talk therapy about your lack of emotions? Have you tried talk therapy for help with this specific problem? 5.) Is it possible you may experience these emotions, but are unfamiliar with them? (Think about this one before answering. Don't blindly say you feel nothing, just numbness. If you can reflect and truly say there is only numbness, that's fine. I just want to be as sure as possible that what we are dealing with is what we think it is. Learning to recognize emotions again is something quite a few people who struggle with depression have to work at. I know i did.) 6.) Do you have a history of mental disorders in your family? If so, which disorders? 7.) Any illegal drug use? (***I realize some people would feel uncomfortable providing the answers to some of these questions. That's fine, i wont press if you are uncomfortable. Answer only ones in your comfort zone, and answer honestly please. The more information we have to look at, though, the better chance we have at deciding a course of action***) While all these answers may help us form a more clear picture, it still may take time and work for emotional recovery. What worked best for me was talk therapy. I'm a huge fan of talk therapy above all else. When i was involved in talk therapy, part of my recovery was learning how to recognize my emotions, and learning when it was ok to be mad at someone, or when it was normal to feel sadness (not depression, warranted sadness, like if my dog died or something), or when it is normal to be anxious. I even had to relearn when it was appropriate to feel anger for being blatantly cheated out of money by someone else. Talk therapy is a step that should be taken before all other steps, because a counselor/psychologist has had a complete education in these matters, and can provide information about things such as medications, symptoms, screenings for other possible disorders and can even discuss and answer the questions about Anhedonia you have. Also, i would trust a psychologist over a website for information. You KNOW the psychologist has degrees and certifications for exactly these types of things. A website can lie, be unintentionally misleading, or misinterpreted. Hang in there, ill visit back often should you want to chat a bit more, ~Robert Edit: Had to include a bit more info, and corrected some grammatical errors.",
      "The numbness that Noitartst describes is something I often think about in relation to depression.  I think I have been numbing out emotions nearly all my life.  I often think that my depression is just that numbing-out of emotions going out of control.  I think numbing out emotions was always the \"safe\" option for me and my depression is just my body trying to be super-safe.  Numbing out emotions is familiar to me and I suppose I have found refuge in the familiar.   The debilitation and pain that comes with my depression is perhaps more familiar than feeling emotions. When I go for periods without depression, I find that I still numb out emotions.  That is just me going back to bad habits I think - probably habits I will never kick entirely, but something I should  tackle.",
      "I know this is some major thread necromancy, as the original thread is from 2011. I'm sorry if this is frowned upon here. However, what Noitartst wrote sounds very, very much like me. If anybody has experience with something similar, I'd be keen to hear. I suppose the difference between me and Noitartst is that I still often feel anxious and not calm. But I am largely out of touch with my emotions. Unlike my previous experiences with depression, this one is massively different: I can (generally) do practical things, go to work etc., but I get no joy or satisfaction from just about anything I do, and I feel like I'm just constantly going through the motions, kind of like acting a role where even I don't really know what that role is supposed to be. I achieve those practical things by distancing myself from them and other people emotionally. Everything's just more or less a blur. At some point I began to question just about everything, which easily turns even momentary good feelings into anxiety. Feelings of uncertainty and emotional insecurity make me socially rather anxious and withdrawing, and since I've been unable to express any of this and tried to keep up a facade in most of my social circles, I've sort of built myself into a situation where the social me is this mostly calm and rational role rather than the anxious and massively insecure guy who has a really hard time dealing with almost any kinds of emotions. I've been kind of trying to act the guy I feel I used to be, but it's been more and more difficult, and I've been getting more and more tired of acting. It seems to be leading nowhere, since emotionally I just haven't been able to be what I used to be. I'm sure many people around me even notice something is not right or the way it used to be, but I haven't been able to blurt out the truth that I've been having some major emotional problems. This has been going on for a few years already, and while I sometimes feel a bit better for a while, sometimes I'm afraid I'm too far down the road to be able to get back. I'm getting talk therapy now (finally) and I hope it's going to help at least a bit. The therapist has already noticed that I intellectualize things a lot, so maybe he could try to help me regain touch with my emotions, at least so some degree. Like Noitartst who started the thread, I've also tried similar things (actually all of those things, although I've mostly done a different martial art). But the issue is that a lot of my original anxiety and pain is actually associated with those things in one way or another, so that has not been helping. And meditation I've found occasionally calming, but at other times just yet another something that I'm forcing myself to do regardless of how I feel, and I then question whether it is a good idea at all or whether it's just going further down the same road. Any experience with something like this?",
      "I want to know this too. I've been in this unemotional comfortable cocoon since the end of high school. I was functioning still on a level, I was actually academically and financially very successful and whatnot, but then I started having a problem with maintaining all that. I'm trying to get back to work at least now after having worked through some issues that crashed down one me on day (not exaggerating). Not all issues, I'm sure... but I now feel like I want to be doing something with my life again. But it looks like I can't while I am in this cocoon. It's incredibly hard to exit it to do things. I always run into very bad emotional pain and whatever negative emotionality. It's insane. Then when I managed to live through it, I can work for a while. Then when I stop work, I often can't boot back up for the next time. I thought I could, but again it's hard to. So I figured I have to get used to the thought that I can (should) no longer exist in my comfortable unemotional \"cocoon\". I somehow have to find a way to actually destroy the cocoon. So that I'm outside it always, even if that means experiencing incredible pain emotionally. Then maybe I'll be able to get through this. I don't know. I don't even know how to finally get rid of the whole cocoon. I really do have to get rid of it though, because when I am inside it (right now too), I'm able to so easily block out any sensible thoughts about how to get on with my life and actually live a full life as the goal. I block out everything really, so then I remain unmotivated and just lose time further. I did break through something about a few weeks ago, where I left some \"hypomanic episodes\" behind that kind of were a waste of time, a distraction from real issues. I did get into some painful stuff then that I worked through since then and it compelled me to fix some situation in my life (and I did fix it finally, that one situation). But I didn't leave the baseline \"unemotional cocoon\" with it. That state matches anergic-anhedonic dysthymia. Any idea on how I can make myself leave it????"

      "I’m not sure if this is the right place to put this out there but i thought i would just do it anyway just to get it off my mind. I’m tired. i’m sad. i’m unhappy with where i am in life, and so i push everyone i love away i’ve gotten so good at it my family doesn’t even bother to call or text or come see me anymore. I think it’s better that way to be honest. Well my dad still texts and calls it kills me inside when he asks how i am doing and that he loves me. i love him so much and i just wish he would just stop calling me because it makes it harder for me to push him away. i do love my family sometimes i think i love them more than they love me. I really feel like my life is just pointless, a waste of time. i don’t deserve to be here i don’t deserve to be happy or to have any one love me. Some days i just want to be gone off this earth to never of exsisted. I’ve seen my two older brother go on trips together with their girlfriends they have so much fun together and i’m never there with them they are always so happy together, it makes me think that they would be fine without me. i know they would be ive seen them they don’t need me. Whenever we are together with their girlfriends they never talk to me they always push me aside never ask for my thoughts or opinions i don’t understand why they continue to drag me along sometimes maybe because they feel bad for me because i have no friends. Most of the time though they do stuff without me i’m use to that though it hurts but i’ve accepted it. My mother and i were never close we live in the same town and yet we never talk or see each other probably for the better. i always knew deep inside she never liked or cared for me the way she does for my two other brothers. Most days i feel so so tired and i’m stuck in bed for days. I cry a lot by myself i don’t think anyone really understand what i’m going through. I’ve told my brothers i might have depression and yet still no calls or texts and i am okay with that i like to be alone i’ve been alone my whole life. i’ve never connected with anyone i’ve never fully opened up to anyone and i don’t think i ever will. Most days i just pretend like i’m okay. especially at work i’ve gotten so good at it that i don’t even realize i’m doing it. i don’t know how much longer i can keep this up. i just feel so alone and sad and heavy like this weight is just hanging off of my body i don’t think it will ever go away and i don’t know if i can hold up for much longer. i do think about ending my life i think about it almost every day yet i’m still here and i don’t know why.",
      "Looks like I wrote this ....... completely the same for me and I can understand, not know of course, how you feel.  I also fake it a work and really don't want family close.  I sometimes think I should need friends, but never seem to connect so have given that thought up for good.  Internally, I just don't care anymore and having a fatal \"accident\" would be just fine .... any time now.   I already take antidepressants, which hardly make a dent.  Yeah, I just don't know where my place is or would be in this world and, again, don't know if I care either.  I really don't feel sorry for myself or deprived without human contact .... I really don't care at all .... hard to describe, but you described it really accurately  in your post for sure.",
      "I know the feeling friends. The \"Fake it till you make it\" sense. I have no friends because when someone does come around, they can't handle me for more than a week or so, then they leave and i never hear from them again. If i see them around, they purposely look for a way to avoid me. My family gave up on me sometime around year five of persistent depression. No calls, no emails, no texts. Even people who had been my lifelong friends that were closer to me than my own family left me after awhile. I really don't have that bad of a life. Great kids, decent home life and nothing really to be depressing. I'm just hating every moment of life every day. It is what it is though i guess.",

      "I recommend nurturing your relationships. Perhaps you can catch up with old friends and make new ones! Looking back on your life, are there people you could maybe check in on and ask how they are doing? You may feel vulnerable, but gently pressuring yourself to reach out could reap many benefits. Maybe you’ll make a new friend! I think you need more people in your life, and a good support system. Loneliness can make you depressed. There are a lot of people out there looking for connection. Find them! I went through all my Facebook friends and wrote a list of the ones I’d like to check in on and ask how they are. I messaged hundreds of old friends and ended up catching up with a few dozen. Dating apps I have found is a great way to find new friends. People want to be there for you. Open up a little bit, if you can. Tell your story. I swear talking or messaging with someone about what you’re going through and how you feel can do wonders for your mood. You can do it! Reach out. Make connections. I’m here for you if you ever want to talk. Best of luck to you!"

      "First, let me say, this might be a really stupid post and if it is then I apologize.  OK, so, I am 16, female, live in the USA.  I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (I was diagnosed when I was 13, but I think I've had it for longer than that).  My doctor says that it is biological, but what I don't understand is why it is happening.  What I mean is that no one else in my family has depression.  Other people in my family have mental illness, but not depression (I have an aunt who is schizophrenic and my mom has some problem, but I don't really know what the diagnosis is and she won't talk about it).  My father was adopted, so maybe there is something in his family, but he definitely doesn't have depression.  I've had things happen in my life that I know have led other people to be depressed, but those things don't really seem to affect me, at all (not in that way, anyway).  Other things that other people have said \"well, you've done this\" or \"this happened to you\", those things don't really seem to make me depressed, at all, either.  I have been suicidal, off and on, since I think I was 11 (and suicide is always in the back of my mine, though right now I am not consider doing it).  No one in my biological family has ever committed suicide (or, as far as I know, even considered it).  So why is this happening to me?",
      "JessicaLuR wrote: why is this happening to me? I'm not sure anyone can definitively answer why it happens. Inheritance, life experiences, how you react to those experiences, and how your brain develops can all play into whether or not you end up with depression.  I think the important thing is you already have a diagnosis and are under the care of a professional.  I'm happy you were able to talk to someone IRL and get support for yourself. JessicaLuR wrote: no one else in my family has depression.  Other people in my family have mental illness, but not depression (I have an aunt who is schizophrenic and my mom has some problem, but I don't really know what the diagnosis is and she won't talk about it). Yes you can inherit traits from your parents, but if you are curious look back further to your grandparents.  Sometimes the traits can be recessive and can seem to skip a generation but still be carried on to you.  Also I think the saying \"history doesn't always repeat itself but it often rhymes\" applies here.  You aren't necessarily looking for an exact match to your diagnosis, just a pattern. You are young and your brain is still developing.  You diagnosis could change as you get into your early 20s. So I am 25/f and am diagnosed with Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder.  My depressive episodes happen in cycles.  Medication makes the lows less intense but I still experience them.  I wasn't diagnosed until college, but looking back I know I've been dealing with this since about 10th grade. I got through high school dealing with a lot of suicidal ideation and using unhealthy coping mechanisms to keep myself safe. And because I would eventually cycle out of my lows I just assumed it was over and wouldn't reoccur. I know you said you are feeling ok atm, but ideally you don't want to be experiencing suicidal ideations. Please talk to your Dr about it if this is still happening to you. And try talking to your mom again.  You deserve to know your family's medical history.",
      "My dad looked back into our family history to trace our last name, genealogy and lineage as far back as he could. There were generational  'gaps' and relatives that the family just didn't talk about and we knew little about them. Many were just as soon forgotten by the family. I have to think that some of these ancestors had mental illnesses or disorders. 50+ years ago there was a stigma about mental illness, disorders and alcoholism, etc. The medical community didn't understand it like they do today and there were few medications or treatments that helped. Depression was called melancholia and alcoholism was just a moral failing of character. You were just 'defective' somehow. Those afflicted could just 'cheer up' or stop drinking if they really wanted to. Some of my ancestors were institutionalized or placed in an asylum. Like they just simply dropped off the face of the Earth. We just didn't understand mental illness at the time and didn't know what to do with these people. How sad that people had to suffer inhumanely like this, but we just didn't know any better at the time. My dad's brother had electroshock therapy after the trauma of being a Marine at Iwo-Jima in WWII. He finally had a lobotomy in the early 1950's to make him forget what he experienced. I remember him as being docile. He didn't show much of any emotion. He had to be cared for and was never really independent. I was sad for him. War does that to people. Some depression is situational, such as loss or grief. These days we live in enlightened times where we now know that depression and anxiety are treatable disorders and alcoholism (addictions) are a treatable disease. We understand the mechanisms of brain chemistry, the bio-electrical firing across the synapses, nuero-transmitter action and how they affect the mind. We are only beginning to understand these illnesses for what they really are and making great strides to treat them. I was on a combination of meds about 20 years ago to treat my depression. The same meds were also used to treat my anxiety. Counseling was also provided along with the meds. It was intensive at first, then backed off as I got better and needed it less. I am grateful for the people that cared for me and about me enough to help me get through a sad chapter in my teens and 20's and become successful at life. Best of luck to you.",
      "I'm confused. you keep saying the things that have happened in your life haven't affected you/made you depressed, yet you say you've been suicidal basically your whole life. seems to me, if you're suicidal, then you're affected by it. I think you're either lacking the self awareness to recognize the connection here, or you're confused about what it actually means to be depressed. do you expect it to manifest in you in a certain way that you haven't experienced? do you not consider suicidal ideation a symptom of depression? genuinely curious.",
      "Thank you so much for replying.  I know I've inherited other problems from my family.  Maybe, as you said Shattered Mind, it skipped a generation and it is in my father's side of the family. Thank you for telling me your story, Wally58.  It is nice to not be alone. Rainbow_sprinkles, when I say that those things haven't affected me I mean that I don't feel sad or down at all when I think about those things.  They don't really bother me.  I know that I have depression.  I have almost every symptom in the DSM 5.  What I'm saying is that I don't understand WHY I am depressed, when no one else in my family (at least that I know of) is depressed and I don't feel like it is the circumstances in my life making me depressed.  If it is biological then others in my family should have it; if it is environmental then I should be able to point to SOMETHING that is causing the depression.",

      "I do understand.  I've been in therapy for almost 3 years and my therapist has gone over these things with me.  Yes, I know that it is more than feeling sad.  As I said, I have almost every symptom in the DSM 5. I get that it is biological.  So, if it is biological and it isn't genetic then where did it come from?",
      "rainbow_sprinkles wrote: clinical depression is a result of dysfunctional brain chemistry, has nothing to do with your surroundings or events in your life Hi, out of curiosity do you have a reference for this? I could be wrong but if you look at the NIMH website \"the cause is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors\". JessicaLuR wrote: So, if it is biological and it isn't genetic then where did it come from? Well, you're missing half of your family history so it could well be in there. That said, aside from one cousin who is bipolar there in no history of any mental illness in my family - nothing - for the previous two generations.  So even if you couldn't find anything on your Dad's side,  you wouldn't be alone with that. Going back to the beginning of this thread you wrote \"I've had things happen in my life that I know have led other people to be depressed, but those things don't really seem to affect me.\" So to you these events were worth remembering.  If they were unimportant you would have likely forgotten about them.  This can change how you behave going forward even if it is not on a conscious level.  Basically something bad happened to you or you saw something bad happen. Normally a person will protect themselves from that going forward, or at least try to.  But it can have unintended consequences depending on how those events changed you.",
      "I have always heard it is a combination of genetic/biological factors and environment, but my doctor told me that for me it was probably much more my biology.  I haven't told him the things that I went through, but again I really don't think that those things affect my depression. As far as the things that happened: it isn't that they aren't unimportant, it is that they don't really affect my depression - they don't make me feel sad or upset, at all.  I have other people that I've known that have had similar things and they HAVE said that they are upset and bothered by them and they do think that it is a cause of their depression (I was in a depression group for teens for a year).  Maybe you are right, maybe they are affecting me totally subconsciously, but I am not sure how I would know that, you know?  Ha ha!  But I do know that things can have unintended consequences. Thank you to all the people who have been replying.  You have all given me things to think about!"

      "When I initially said you should stick with school I thought you had already completed part of your masters.  Honestly, if you are already this unhappy I would drop all your classes and recover what money you can. College is expensive.  There are cheaper and more productive ways to pass your time than sitting in classes that you hate.  I know I'm stating the obvious but you need to figure out what you want to do.  Maybe for now you could volunteer someplace while you look for a paying job.",
      "i've been searching for a job since 2016 but not getting one. so masters is the only way to improve my education n resume profile. i'm applying for jobs. i have time till next friday till i can get college refund."

      "It would appear that I don't genuinely laugh much anymore. Every year I get older; I laugh less- and grow more serious. I really envy, but also admire people who can just live their lives and laugh. They laugh to feel happy! But what do you do when you CANT laugh? There are lots of things I find funny! but... how do I explain... the more life I experience, the more difficult it is let loose and LAUGH OUT LOUD. I'll laugh a little in my head, or a short grunt of some sort will come out. when your in a social setting, it sounds weird. So, when I'm surrounded by people and we're watching a comedy or talking about something funny; I have no choice but to FORCE laughter . sometimes I feel it's at least partly genuine. but You know when you're laughing continuously? like there's no \"cue\" to STOP laughing... for example, I said to someone something funny yesterday. We both started chuckling, she hit my arm like people do when they're laughing with you..she was laughing pretty hard. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I get self conscious about what my laugh sounds like and what I look like when i laugh ...I also don't find the situation funny at all anymore. (I'll do that- just, It's not funny anymore. It's \"serious time\") I don't WANT to get \"serious\"; It just happens. So i ABRUPTLY stop laughing, followed by an intense frown. The other person soon takes note, makes a weird face (as if their thinking- umm... Is he okay? Did I do something?)... There are times where a situation that calls for humour and laughter brings about no emotion in me. I just feel dead inside. I may not even be acutely depressed at the time. I just don't laugh out loud. I'll try to though as I'm aware I'm expected to. The laughter that comes out will sound awkward and forced. I've been told this by people; so more and more lately I just isolate myself as I'm growing more and more self conscious. I hate the sound of my laugh; I sound like an idiot. But If I don't laugh I appear as emotionless. so... I'm at a loss here guys. I don't know what to do.",
      "It sounds like you're deflecting your gaze onto laughter instead of dealing with the actual issue. Why are you so concerned with how you sound or look? What is occurring during those moments that needs to be taken so seriously? I am the same in all honestly but I haven't dealt with my hang ups entirely yet.",
      "I'm so concerned with what I sound like and look like because people have told me i look and sound weird. It started one day when i was hanging out with my friend Cody several months back... she said to me: \"you look really uncomfortable when you talk to me.\" (i was very anxious that day). there was also another time when she (cody) said \"are you alright? why do you sound so sad?' I FELT COMPLETELY NORMAL at that time..and to her, i sound depressed. Also, I was hanging out with my brother and his friend one day a few weeks back and they laughed amongst theirselves everytime I laughed out loud. my brother [Josh] later told me that his friend (david) makes fun of the way I laugh [especially when Im working at sobeys... he and my bro also work at the same store I do]...and just a few days ago my friend Kat immitated my laugh and somewhat sarcastically remarked: 'I like your laugh.'...and theres more instances that have happened... ...the thing is, I know quite a few people DO like me... i feel as if, however, that my insecurities and awkwarness will always prevent me from pursuing more meaningful relationships... ie, the way Iaugh..how I care too much about what others think. I have ADHD and speech problems too... and i norice im growing less and less interested in being social because i cant take the anxiety and embarassment anymore... i am a strong determined person that is giving up more and more.....",

BonjourJakk wrote: and i norice im growing less and less interested in being social because i cant take the anxiety and embarassment anymore... i am a strong determined person that is giving up more and more..... You don't need to be embarrassed. You've been conditioned to feel that way but you can reverse it. Also in all relationships there are bound to be embarrassing moments and anxiety. There are also worse things that you will end up facing if you haven't already. But it doesn't mean that the relationships are less meaningful. It's part of what makes them real. You already know that your friends see past your laugh and like you. What more does one need? This is my opinion. You don't have to agree with me. If I had a quick fix I would give it to you without hesitation, but unfortunately I don't.",

      "I am 20 year old male who loves to sing. The reason I say this is because I have been told since middle school by people specifically my parents and obviously choir teachers. Well a couple years ago I started wondering what others sound like to them and obviously if I sounded more bad tbey would most likely lie. So I decided to start recording myself, so eventually asked my mom then and she said I still sounded fine. Well I'm in college now and decided I want to be in college choir for my next year for fun. The thing is I started recorded singing again and got same similar results from before in my opinion. So I did things to fibally listen with other techniques and it sounded the same as recordings. The reason I am posting this is because I don't know what to do now, I am depressed about this because first of all I really always liked singing but being insecure already I don't want to make things worse. I am really confused and not sure I feel like I have lived a lie a lot of my life now because I loved singing and trusted it was good. To add one more thing I was so shy about things loke this so I never sang like in front of a whole bunch of people. I would appreciate any advice please!!!!",
      "I also love to sing but hate public performance. Singing is mostly about confidence, but who cares if other people don't like your singing anyways? It's still fun."

      "I feel like I'm such a massive failure. Seriously, I never experienced what a normal and average adult experiences. I never had a job, a degree, a car, independence. I still live with my family, and they trigger my depression, because I'm just so angry at them for how they abused me ever since I was small. They never were encouraging or nurturing. Quite the opposite, rather. I very rarely see my friends, because they're busy, live too far, and just don't invite me anywhere. And, of course, there are other things contributing to my depression, which I am not comfortable talking about. My depression is so bad that I can't get a job and college overwhelms me so much. I've been depressed for a very long time, and been seeking treatment just as such. I was doing well for a while, but new things (or lack thereof) started happening, which made my depression come back. I've been trying so hard to get past this, by trying to go back to college, by making new friends, and so on, but it's all futile. It's just so hard to make friends, because of my social anxiety, my lack of communication, and just the overall feeling of people not liking me. Maybe, after a decade of suffering, I'm still in emotional shock. The end of everything worth meaningful in life happened due to a very traumatic experience, which left me with nothing real, regarding companionship, esteem, strength, so on. I just have... nothing, other than a roof over my head. I have nothing an average adult has. I wish I did, but I've been fighting this for so long, that I just don't have the will-power or strength anymore, even though I'm not working hard enough. I kind of gave up hope, as well. I'm afraid of happiness and independence, because every single effort and opportunity ended up with nothing. I'm terrified that it will all just be false hope, and I talk myself down into thinking of negative aspects that would happen, just like how my parents do when I tell them about my ambitions. I tried so hard to face my fears and anxiety, but all positivity was false hope in the end. I'm terrified of facing disappointment again. I just want to die. I have nothing. One may think these are easily solvable, but they're not. I want to die because I'm such a failure",
      "Gentle hugs, if wanted. When there is life, there's always hope. We are all failures, on some level. You are seeing someone for this? Are you taking anything for depression?",
      "Yes to both. Have been for a real long time",
      "I think while there's life, there is always hope, even if we don't feel as is there is. Certainly it is very easy for me to feel hopeless. You allude to a singular event that destroyed a life worth living, care to elaborate?",
      "It was really painful to read your situation. There are many people out there, about 5%, that are going through depression at a time, 20% of these are going through clinical depression, like you are and like I did once. I went through clinical depression, when I was 14 and felt like you do now. How long have you going been through this? Well, the main reason behind my depression was obsessive compulsive disorder, and social anxiety. I grew up as a child always bullied by his classmates and insulted by his parents. I think I can relate to you a little bit. Thus I had severe social anxiety and hardly had any friends. But the bigger problem and the main trigger behind my clinical depression was severe OCD. It was too strong for me to handle. Due to the never ending ocd and the suffering it bought and the way I felt I was getting worse day by day, I developed feelings of apathy towards life, like nothing mattered to me anymore, and feelings of hopelessness that it will never get better. We can call it depression, can't we. Every single attempt that I made felt useless. It felt like I was like an animal trapped in a net, the more I struggle to free myself, the more stuck and entangled I get. I started feeling like I am loosing my mind and that I will end up mad. Due to this, I started getting more and more isolated. Bullying increased too because I was weaker and more easily irritated. It felt like everyone hated me and that my mere existence bothers every one. My grades started falling. I begin loosing my looks and charm, because I dropped alot of weight and got really thin. I was in school back then, and it seems like you are in college. It is not too late to despair. You can go back to college, study and then get a job. Your parents were not nice to you, though they should have been, but it was not your fault, of course. You can still be happy though and live a good life. You said you went through a traumatic experience. Can you tell what it was. You are totally anonymous here and no one will judge you badly. At last, I want to tell you a secret. I am free of depression. I have left it in the past and thanks to God, I am really very happy now. Like you, I failed a lot of times, but I kept trying until the day I finally made it. That day, my depression stopped getting worse and I started getting batter. Day after day I felt happier and easier with myself and the world. I remember how it felt back then. I was less afraid of real things and sweated over small things that haunted me back then. I didn't trusted those who said that I could get better. Inspiring words didn't inspire me anymore. I felt so down and felt like I didn't have the energy to put myself back in order. But it all got correct. I swear I am not lying or giving you false hope. The habit that saved me was never to give up. I did feel very hopeless, but I kept going and trying to get better. But you couldn't try to forcefully make yourself happy. You couldn't force yourself to believe everything is fine, when you know or think that it's not. You couldn't force yourself to relax, nor could you lie to yourself. The way to pull  yourself out of clinical depression is not to eat a magic pill or to instantly jump out of depression. If depression is like a wound, it will take time to heal. I kept trying and trying, and those tries were to discipline my life, to sleep at time, to eat healthy, to exercise and to avoid toxic people and those things that gave me stress. I tried remembering the good times, counting my blessing not my flaws, looking at good side of people and things, abiding by good character, socializing in my own family and very close friends whom I trusted and who never judged me(my brother and a cousin) and maintaing a stable mood and a hope that things will be good again one day. And I did begin feeling happy and hopeful because deep in my heart(mind) I knew that there is a way out of depression. That's why cognitive behavioural therapy is so effective, but it takes time. And yeah I got out of depression without consulting a psychiatrist, but instead, I started taking interest and studying psychology articles online about depression, social anxiety and OCD and it helped me immensely. Once you have awareness and knowledge of how to solve this depression problem, you are in control of yourself then and you will be well soon. You are depressed for a reason, a real reason relating to life problems, and if it could be fixed you would be fine once again. And you could fix it. You could develop social skills, go back to college, complete your studies, and get a job and become independent. (being really happy between people is difficult when you are depressed but you could learn and act on some basic and superficial social skills to help you in social skills, I did the same when I was depressed.) But of course doing this all needs activation energy which you hardly have because you are depressed. Well I managed to get A*s in my subjects in school even when I was depressed. I did this with the help of the psychological knowledge and advice that I got on internet. So if I can you can too! Your depression is not only because of this, you are depressed because of a traumatic experience also. Please let us know what it is so we could offer you some help. Now, I am about to enter college. I must admit that I am not very social even now, but I do have friends now and I can feel easy in social situations. OCD had ended. I am healthy now and very happy with my life. You would be too one day, but for now you need healing so take it slowly. Within few months, severe depression could end and you will be going through mild depression, and then that's when things get easy and you know life will be totally back normal within 'y' days, where y is a small number.",
      "Severe depression is such a terrible feeling that even death sounds better. Remember that it is only temporary and to try to enjoy the little things in life: coffee, food, sleeping, exercise, sunshine, music, etc. As you made clear it's not just a chemical imbalance but our life situation. If you can't change your situation, do your best to cope with it for now."

      "I'm not sure if this is the right forum to post this kind of question on as this is my first post on this site but since I suffer from depression, I thought this might be the right place. I'm probably as busy as most people with work and family commitments, but I'm struggling with the times I have time to myself.   I don't have friends or hobbies.  Sleeping is one of my favourite things because for that period of time, it's like I don't exist.   Something I've been doing lately is playing an online game where the aim is to be the last survivor in a battle between you and up to 99 other people.   My problem is that this activity that is meant to give me some kind of joy and fun stresses me out.  I get angry with myself for losing, for not being better at it, for wasting my time on something like this when I know I have other things to get done.   It must give me some kind of high or sense of happiness because I keep playing it.  I've reinstalled the game 5 times after deleting it out of anger. What do I do? Do I continue to play the game and try to work through these feelings or is this contest based environment a trigger I should avoid and find an alternative activity?",
      "Stop playing the game. If it's making you unhappy, you don't need it in your life. Another piece of advice- do things. You don't have to do big things like pick up a major hobby if it is too overwhelming for you right now (though that sounds like it could be a long-term goal) just try to do simple things with your time, like go for walks. It'll make you feel better.",
      "I'm not sure how I missed this response, but thanks for the advice",
      "Sleep heals the mind, spirit and body. When I took a sabbatical to work on personal matters that had come to a head, I was told by the doctors to use this time to work on myself. They convinced me that there was no time like the present to get this done as I may not get a 2nd chance. This was 30 years ago and they were right. I got some personal matters attended to before re-entering the rat race of work and family. I look back at my time off to heal and do some introspection. I am grateful for the time I had as there would be no way now that I could put life-things on hold to work on myself again. Best of luck to you.",

      "For me it was about 18 months to recover from alcoholism, burnout, panic attacks and depression. I was able to re-enter functionality with a fresh outlook and attitude when I said that I was ready to. Many people may never get the chance to put things on hold like I did, but I really had no other alternative at the time. I had a lot of support in doing this. Positive support is very important to have on your side."

      "I think if you posted this in Bipolar, some people be nodding their heads... this sounds kinda like a manic or hypomanic thing.  Just a quick Google and found a link saying that taking something like Sertraline without a mood stabilizer can kick someone with Bipolar into manic/hypermanic.  And I know one or two folks with Bipolar that get hypersexuality. I think some of the bipolar, you just need to have had one episode to have that Dx- so even if you haven't had a history of it, this might be a bipolar thing?  Best thing would be to ask in that forum.  I don't know a whole lot about bipolar other than I might be type two, but I haven't studied into it.",

Could these side affects be related to an underlying illness perhaps?? Anyone experienced these side affects before?? Sounds exactly like me when I was on a moderate dose of Prozac, an SSRI like Sertraline. The issue with having a hypomanic episode [or a manic episode] on an SSRI is that you can either just be sensitive to SSRIs and experience mania as a side effect, or have underlying bipolar disorder. In my personal opinion, I believe the former is more common -- there have been various studies conducted on SSRI-induced mania and it's not as rare as doctors say it is. For an example, read this study: https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/jnp.23.3.jnpe23 [I even spoke to my last therapist about this, and she agreed that just because you have mania from an SSRI doesn't necessarily equal 'bipolar']. When I was hypomanic on Prozac, my worst symptom was hypersexuality, too, and generally being impulsive -- talking way too much, oversharing, and thinking I was smarter and cooler than I actually am [LOL...]. Which, you could argue, is also a sign of poor judgment. Now that you're off of the Sertaline, do you feel more like your old self? It took me a few weeks after I tapered off SSRIs to feel 'normal' again.",

Sounds exactly like me when I was on a moderate dose of Prozac, an SSRI like Sertraline. The issue with having a hypomanic episode [or a manic episode] on an SSRI is that you can either just be sensitive to SSRIs and experience mania as a side effect, or have underlying bipolar disorder. In my personal opinion, I believe the former is more common -- there have been various studies conducted on SSRI-induced mania and it's not as rare as doctors say it is. For an example, read this study: https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/jnp.23.3.jnpe23 [I even spoke to my last therapist about this, and she agreed that just because you have mania from an SSRI doesn't necessarily equal 'bipolar']. When I was hypomanic on Prozac, my worst symptom was hypersexuality, too, and generally being impulsive -- talking way too much, oversharing, and thinking I was smarter and cooler than I actually am [LOL...]. Which, you could argue, is also a sign of poor judgment. Now that you're off of the Sertaline, do you feel more like your old self? It took me a few weeks after I tapered off SSRIs to feel 'normal' again. Not exactly!! I had been on Sertraline for so long that it has made my recovery longer than expected and I am still suffering the consequences of my actions after taking this medication."

      "i was wondering how is one supposed to improve or help their condition, in this case, i have major depression, which has been chronically affecting me for many many years, i can't really put a finger on when it \"Started\" ( not because i can't give reasons to it ) but because it seems like i have had it most of my life or since possibly early puberty ( long story ). i am 25 years old now. i wanted to just point something out that really pissed me off because i felt like the source was invalid and flat out wrong, but from what i read from several sources, they will say that a general statement like psychiatric drugs do more harm than good and are only useful or should be used for the most severe cases, but as someone who has severe depression myself, i do not agree with this at all. if anything, it should be the opposite, because someone with severe \"depression\" is unlikely to be helped by a simple medication, they need much more conscious assistant and help in various aspects, i am not talking about someone who is literally in the midst of attempting suicide or can barely move, although i do feel like that at times, it's complex. all im saying is that there needs to be better understanding on solutions, treatment, and explanations, and unfortunately, for me, i've felt like a \"missing link\" in all this, seeing different psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, doctors, left and right, unnecessarily put myself out there and played the innocent open role of whatever, i'll take psychiatric medication, only to end up worse before and after taking them. not to mention that my diagnosis's seem to be unclear, although modality doesn't seem to matter when you have depression, at least in my case, there are a \"few\" things i would want to do to improve my life to the capacity i have, but even with those, it's painfully difficult and / or i just feel biologically and psychologically handicapped, and people don't seem to understand that, and when i try to explain certain things from various areas ( when i talk to therapists mostly ), they just interpret everything i say in a black and white way or they will only give answers back in a way that instinctive but not necessarily valid, i'm not sure if people would get that. anyways, my point is that i really don't know what to do, i can't afford homeopathy / neuropathy appointments with a doctor to even find out if it can be useful and i do not see any point going back to a psychiatrist to tell them, i am not gonna take one of those damn pills and suffer in more #######4 that i already, so please, can you give me perhaps a prescription to a homoepathic or nueropathic solution instead, and of course they will be like, no, we can't do that. i also have schizotypal personality disorder and i relate to the condition sluggish cognitive tempo or also called concentration deficit disorder, i related to those two things ever since early puberty. what pissses me off too is all the people on youtube and the forums that talk about it, arent people that really have it, and are really people with a subtype of ADHD, subtype meaning part of the same disorder of ADHD. Russell Barkley himself conducted research on actual \"Sct\" people, and found that like 90 percent of them did not respond well to stimulants, that it more or did nothing useful for them, although he said it doesn't harm them, in my case, when i took most of any type of stimulants like vyvanse or ritalin, they did nothing positive for me other than making me more depressed, stressed and anxious, and further lowered my immune system, so barkley's statement of they don't harm \"them\", i would say is false, because they do harm \"me\". Oddly enough, most of these youtube / forum people claiming they have sct actually said they did better on stimulants, despite Barkley's actual studies showing the opposite. i do not have much of hope for anything, i struggle financially, i have chronic back pain, weak back and spine and other physical problems, and NO! they are not random at ALL! a previous doctor has asked if it was random. they have a logical a long explanation, the least of which is lack of exercises / stretching for a very long time, combined with poor lifestyle, coping, environment issues, etc. i have tried some herbal stuff like st. johns wort and rhodiola, i felt like either they were too strong and / or working the wrong areas of my brain / body. rhodiola in my experience was not compatible for my brain chemistry and issues, all it did was make me very stressed, agitated, and did the opposite of what my body needs, my depression is caused by being overworked in the first place and distress and rhodiola does pretty much that, it works on all the wrong areas of my brain, particularly the frontal lobe where as my issues are more felt back of the brain of posterior cortex / hypothalamus? as a matter of fact, i get on and off brain inflammation, brain squeezing feeling or like it feels like it's gonna explode, usually happens if i use the computer for too much, play video games too much, listen to music too much, or any type of electronic stimulation or even social interactions, also sexual release plays a part, because i have a 24 hour thing where the 12-24 period after i ejaculated i am the most \"functional\", as in able to barely communicate and get my needs met with things or around others, but around 24 hours or later, the depression takes over, and my face becomes very droopy and hanging, i can barely keep my eyes open, things become very foggy, and i get a gradually increasing brain inflammmation with a constant active and excruciating stress, also if it goes on any longer, perhaps 2 days or more, i can't even eat any meals or if i can eat any food, it might be limited to crackers which i might be able to physically put in my mouth and swallow, and taking ativan does nothing, other than lowering any low grade anxiety i have, but that's not what i really have in this state, it's more of extreme stress and brain inflammation and low on certain biological functions such as probably dopamine and / or serotonin or other things like opiates, who knows? i have only been able to work once recently with the help of a job helping organization, which is supposed to be meant for pretty much anyone who needs extra help in getting employed, i wasn't able to work for more than like 2 days, the chronic back pain, fatigue physically and emotionally, combined with my untreated depression and job demands were way too much for me, it felt like i worked for a month in just that day or two.",
      "Wow, it sounds like you have really been through so much. I can relate, I know it's hard when there are multiple layers of suffering, especially when one of them is chronic pain and/or illness. [Thyroid and some joint pain have gotten me down, too...and they only make my depression worse. I can sympathize with your back pain, because when my thyroid problems first hit, I had such severe lower back pain that I could barely get up off the couch.] It's worth looking into getting a full work-up of your hormones through a saliva testing kit online. I know that's not free or cheap, per say, but 100-200 dollars into the kit is a sound investment. Your nutrient and hormone levels could be totally off, and making your depression so much worse. For example, I had incredibly low vitamin D and that caused my lower back pain. B12 and the other B vitamins are important for your wellbeing and neurological health. Cortisol shouldn't be too high, or else you'll be sick in many ways. Etc. Your extreme pain and fatigue and 'brain inflammation' make me wonder if your thyroid is also involved, too. A severe thyroid problem can make your brain feel like it's in a fog, like your whole body is heavy. If you have Hashi's, you can swing between hypo- and hyperthyroid, low to high energy. Let me forewarn you that most doctors have no idea what the hell they're doing when it comes to hormone testing. Just stick with the kit, and share your results with a thyroid support forum to see what herbal remedies you can use and how you need to change your diet, etc. until you can afford a homeopathic endocrinologist, if your thyroid is out of whack. It also pays to mention that most of our serotonin is made in the gut. I remember reading a study that even patients with severe schizophrenia showed improvement when placed on a low-carb, moderate protein, and moderate fat diet high in omega 3 fatty acids. Minimal gluten, vegetable oils, and processed sugars/high sugar fruits works well, too. I'm changing my diet now and trying low-carb/a version of Keto and seeing how that works for my mental state. [Unfortunately, you might have some initial mood swings and a flare up of symptoms when you drastically change your diet, but this shouldn't last for more than one or two weeks at most.] I haven't tried St. Johns Wort, but what was it like for you? I also can't take SSRIs or any kind of medication because a, i became manic on Prozac and paranoid on Wellbutrin and b, I 100% agree that being dependent for life on pills is a bad idea. I've been toying with the idea of going back on something else temporarily, but I saw another shrink and she was super worried about my past reactions to drugs...it's really exhausting having to fight this battle, but at least know you are not alone. I understand. Hopefully you won't mind me adding this too, but ... it sounds like your condition[s] have really consumed your heart and soul, you've probably poured hours and hours of research or Internet time into figuring this out, and I highly recommend making sure you take time off of yourself and worry because it will make your issues so much worse. Other than playing video games and listening to music, maybe you can start doing some stress-relieving things that lower your brain's energy waves and aren't as stimulating? Like reiki body work, yoga, massage, floating in the pool, or those floating chambers you can go in that feel like you're weightless [sorry, I forget the name]."

      "I've never felt like I wanted to live, but I kept going forward holding onto a hope that things would get better at certain points in my life, but it never does so now I'm starting to feel like things will never get better.  I'm starting to feel like the only thing I can hope for anymore is death. I feel completely useless no matter what anyone else thinks.  I've never had anyone tell me they dislike me or that I'm a burden, but I feel like a burden to anyone I come into contact with.  Many people tell me that I'm smart, but I still always feel completely incompetent.  At work everyone makes jokes about how I must be some kind of superhuman because of how much I do, but I still feel like I'm terrible at my job.  I know it's irrational, but even knowing it's irrational it doesn't change how I feel.  I actually often have the thought that maybe I really am as useless as I think I am and that everyone else around me is just mistaken or don't know me well enough to realize how useless I am. I work at a retail store despite having two college degrees because after obtaining the degrees I felt like I would be too incompetent to work in the fields so I never pursued a job in the fields.  It even took me awhile to actually get a job at the retail store after obtaining the degrees because I felt I would be too incompetent to even do that. I can't remember the last time that I didn't wish that I had never existed and the only hope I feel I have left is for death to come as soon as possible and end my torture.  I don't know what to do anymore, the only option I feel I have is to endure the torture until I die.",
      "I was in treatment for depression and anxiety/panic disorder. I was inpatient for awhile when I mentioned hurting myself. I did respond to therapy and medication and it took a lot of time, but I came out the other end of it. Several medications were tried over the course of my treatment. No instant gratification, just encouragement. Some of the patients I went through the system with are gone. There are moments of white-knuckling it and there probably always will be. Am I truly happy today? I don't know for sure. With the panic, deep depression and self-medicating gone, I feel more stable and can function day-to-day. Am I where I want to be? Maybe not, but one has to start from here to get to there. I 'graduated' from the hospital to outpatient, then to aftercare. I attend 12-step (EA/AA) meetings now when I need to. A home group with familiar faces is re-assuring that I'll make it, because I see and hear that they are making it also. Funny that sharing in a cup of coffee with people that I've never met before this has become a ritual in my life. I suppose that fellowship and empathy is the miracle. Best of luck to you.",
      "Many hugs sent you at this time.  Do you see a doctor.  There are meds for chemical imbalance.  Then I strongly recommend a good therapist.  It took me a third try before I got a therapist I liked.  Been seeing her for over 5 years.  Depression can come and go.  But both, meds and therapy have me on the upswing.  Right now I feel low and I'm waiting it out to feel better soon.  I know I will feel better, it's  just a matter of time.  You will feel better too, it's just a matter of time.  I give you hope because if I made it, then you can too.  I have faith in meds and therapy.  Wishing you the best.  How are you feeling right now?",
      "Thanks for the encouragement.  I was seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist a few years ago, but when they thought I might be losing my insurance we didn't schedule anymore appointments.  The therapist was nice, but talking to her didn't really help at all.  The psychiatrist prescribed sertraline, duloxetine and then wellbutrin in that order, but none of them seemed to really do anything. I don't feel as bad as yesterday, but even on the days where I don't feel to bad I still can't help but think that dying is the only thing I have to look forward to. That being said despite constantly thinking of ways I could die, I am not suicidal because I know what a burden it would be to my family and the people who know me."

      "I am wondering if anyone has found that anti-depression medicine like Lexapro actually causes depression.  Before taking the medicine, I was very sensitive and cried a lot.  I started taking 10mg of Lexapro, and have weaned down to 5 mg now.  Now, I am feeling very lazy, no interest in activities, lack motivation to do anything, and sleep a lot (12+ hrs).  I get bored of my job, and bored of the routine life in general.  It seems to be that my \"depression\" has gotten worse after taking the medicine.  Your thoughts?",
      "I haven't thought about suicide, but on weekends I have trouble getting out of bed.  All I want to do is sleep all day.  I have no energy, motivation to do anything.  Is this depression?",
      "newuser, It sounds like depression alright and you fulfill the criteria for the diagnosis of depression from what i can gather in your posts. However, lexapro has not been linked to causing depression. It seems that the lexapro is at too low of a dose of 5mg at the moment and that's why you are feeling so low. Maybe talk about increasing it to 10mg again with your doctor. Based on your symptoms, the doctor can increase it again to 15 and then to 20 to help you get out of the depression.",
      "As a former Lexapro user, let me say this: I first started off with 5mg for the first week, then 10; the 5 was just a safety thing for my mind to get used to it. For the first week and a half, my emotions were exaggerated, i.e. when I was in a good mood, I'd feel elated and I'd be be a bit giggly, but when I was depressed, I was in the pits. I also had to re-learn how to cross the road as I became somewhat over-confident with myself. After about a few months, my mental health was retreating so my doc, with the recommendation of my psych, upped my dosage to 20mg. Same/similar things would happen, feel great, then feel like shyte, not so much, more like 'blips', but on the whole, okay. After many more months, my prescription was upped to 30. I was on Lexapro for at least a year and at 30mg, the medicine is worse than the illness. I'm not trying to sound 'offbeat' here, but my plumbing system became very....reluctant to respond and it would be PAINFUL. After many more months of that kind of mysery and feeling intense frustration of wondering if my life was worth living, I just STOPPED taking the meds. I had enough of taking that shyte and that was it. It was mindfuk. Even to this day, I'm being told that my personality is different from before...I can't see how, I still have CD, anxiety and my life is still shyte. I used to ask myself which was better, committing suicide, or never being born in the first place? I do not profess to be an expert in the field of psychology, I'm just imparting personal experience; in fact, I won't be surprised if no-one responds to this post. Cheers!",
      "People say you shouldn't just stop medication without consulting your doctor.  Sounds like Lexapro didn't help with your depression.  30mg is a high dosage.  If you still have depression, you might want to suggest to your doctor of having you try an anti-psychotic which I believe is stronger in treating depression.  Just Lexapro isn't helping with my depression either.  Sometimes I wonder if it is better to suffer through the depression rather than upping medication and having side-effects. I have never had suicidal thoughts, but if you do, you definitely need medication to treat your depression.",
      "Sometimes anti-depressants can cause the opposite effect. It's not uncommon. Just like how it has the potential to cause suicidal thoughts. It happened with me with Risperdal. (Which is an anti-psychotic, but my point still stands.) I would suggest talking to your psychiatrist about switching to a different anti-depressant. Perhaps one more stimulating, like Effexor. But ultimately, its your & your doctors decision. In reference to the poster who said try an anti-psychotic. I wouldn't go that route until you've tried at least two anti-depressants & they didn't work. Anti-psychotics are powerful drugs with risky side effects. Be wary of starting them up, should be started only if your depression is too strong & fights against the anti-depressants. Personally I would try a mood stabilizer like Lamictal before the anti-psychotic.",
      "Yeah I read somewhere that medicines sometimes may have the opposite effect too.  Thanks for your suggestion on trying another depression med.  I will mention to my doctor.",
      "Your doc put you on lexapro as its the top ssri that an zoloft , its the first line med for a new med user.           5mg is the starter dose  for a week then 10mg an finally 20mg .         Thats most   peoples theraputic dose ,/ 30mg does nothing more than 20 only give more side effects.      I  dont think you gave it a chance, it could be up to 12 weeks at 20mg before you get benefit .      You always get worse before better ,there no such thing as a free ride.       If you dont do the full course you will never know. 5 mg is doing nothing but giveing side effects, If you swap to a new med , dont just give in to side effects or you may as well not take any.   I always do a full course on a new med even if i feel worse , not to the point of killing myself, i dont mean that. but thats the only way i can cross that med off my list altogether.",
      "I don't know if I have depression, or my symptoms are side-effects of Lexapro.  I don't feel like crying, but I just feel tired all the time and don't feel like doing much at home but sleeping.  I think I will stop Lexapro and see what happens.  If that doesn't work, I can try taking 10mg.",

      "So I've got this internet friend Let's just call her Mia. Mia and I have been friends for like 4 months. We actually started talking cause we had an mutual enemy lol and we both were pissed at them. But from that we became quick friends. We talked literally everyday. For hours on end. Mia also had another friends but for some reason during that time her otehr friend wasn't active. But when she was online again Mia created a groupchat where me and the other friend were there. So Mia and that other girl started talking and they talk a lot. More than I talk to Mia. And she seems a bit more cold toward be than she used to be when we talked on private message. Although she's always a bit more friendly in pm idk why. But these aren't the problem. The problem is I'm more connected to her than she is to me. I never had a friend like her in my whole life irl and internet. We are basically the same. She even called me her twin (she still does) but the thing is I'm so connected to her. I'm afraid she just sees me as a normal peer she talks to sometimes and nothing more. or  she'll think im weird for being over attached in a short time. Ahhhhhh I'm going mad and the fact that I have depression is making it worse. And I also had bad experiences with having \"friends\" I guess I'll just have ask Mia if she started not like me as much. But I'm also losing hope cause if she says no then it'll be my fault for trying to be her bestfriend. Got any help? :^)"

      "I have been thinking about how during my first episode of depression, I had nearly all the symptoms of depression, yet when most people would react by withdrawing, I would become more talkative and sociable. It felt forced and I had a compulsion to do it even when I was seriously drained from it.

However, I was no longer able to get pleasure from it, which may have made me more easily give in to the pressure to socialize more than I am comfortable with.

      "I have experienced depression at different levels.  When it isn't so bad, I can still smile and make a joke.  Usually it's a dark joke, but not too dark.  So, I can relate to that.  When hypomanic, I sense nothing of depression and feel like it's completely and finally gone away.  I don't get hypomanic often and when I do, it usually leads to a mixed episode or a manic episode.  I also don't always crash into a depression after hypomania and mania.  I've talked to my doctor and he said that you don't always have to go into depression following an episode.  I am diagnosed bipolar I.  If you are experiencing such symptoms like you express, be sure to follow up with your doctor so you can be treated according to you needs and symptoms. By the way, I have learned from my doctor that when you experience a mixed episode, a person is diagnosed as having bipolar I.  Do you have any type of literature, either online or in the form of a good and reliable book?  There is more descriptions of all levels of bipolar and their symptoms to watch for and the length they last to be a certain type of bipolar (such as bipolar I or bipolar II).  This can help you watch symptoms and tell your doctor about it.  Wishing you the best.",

But then again, I was also being emotionally abused at that time. Does anyone else have this happen to them while depressed? All I've gotten when explaining this is people being confused or doubting it is depression (even though I've been professionally diagnosed). it's really hard to say, you can have a lot on your mind and have a lot of emotions that needs to be released and expressed, which can depend on various factors like the social environment, other factors, etc. i've been told by some person at a mental health place that i may have bipolar ii disorder and \"atypical depression\" which i told him i found that ironic of him mentioning both, despite me not being diagnosed with bipolar disorder of any type, and the atypical depression condition doesn't seem to entail much, because there isn't really any uniform definition for \"Atypical depression\" some sources say one thing and some sources say another for all sorts of conditions. it doesn't seem to matter because i do and have fit all the criteria of depression pretty much, except sort of like the one you pointed out, but that's what makes it confusing because are they treating it in the biological sense or a conscious sense, because if they are basing it off a biological sense more that would causes someone to withdraw too much, then that would make sense for me if my mood, psychological and other factors are affecting me so much, it makes it miserable to do much more than i already can, so i sit back and need time to just \"withdraw\". however, my diagnosis sort of makes it more confusing as i have schizotypal personality disorder and MDD, yet there is clear connection between what is what, why and what sort of help is \"best\" for me. the part you mentioned on starting arguments, etc, it IS sort of a typical aspect of bipolar disorder but not always, i am still unsure myself if i have bipolar disorder, and even if it is true, i wouldn't exclude schizotypal PD as in this case, i believe if that is the case and IF, then i would be suffering from all three, MDD and bipolar II AND schizotypal PD, but i really doubt i have bipolar ii, i feel like the majority of my issues are from interpersonal problems, even when my mood is in a \"Better\" state  or slightly more functional, i am not any different, as a matter of fact, it becomes a double dissociation because it shows how i really function and how i really perceive things in the maximum alive state and capacity i have. although i was more the opposite of you, i attended social gatherings or family get togethers more desperately out of pure boredom, isolation, and unfavorable lifestyle, circumstances, and coping, but to a lesser extent over time because i realized how disconnected, inferior and apathy i had when doing things, on top of the interpersonal conflicts, not being able to get along with others, despite having a friendly or polite demeanor, it seemed that i enjoyed and still up to this point, family get togethers more than people more my age ( im 25 now ). one simple explanation could be that i didn't have to worry about being responsible for anything ( not to sound like i calling myself lazy as i am not ), but because things were simply too much for me and people weren't or arent as \"mature\". this is why more recently, i've been doing this more alone, come at will and leave at will, then i dont have to worry about any #######4, sort of like a schizoid, only i'm not \"schizoid\", im \"schizotypal\".",

      "While kindergarten and grade school days are often spent building friendships for other children,I often found these times rather challenging socially.  I wanted so bad to fit in and to not let my parents down  but whenever I tried to make friends I kept failing, because of my naiveness and my lack of understanding how to start a conversation and how to keep it going. Even just playing with other children was hard, first of all because i thought that playing was stupid (I didn't see the point of it), and second of all because playing required talking and I was bad at that. Nothing smart came out of mouth apparently, because when I was 7 the only friend I had, thought i wasn't good enough and started making fun of me. The thing is that ever since I was in kindergarten the talking-mode wasn't my automatic mode: I was a quiet person who enjoed talking to others only when there was a very compelling reason to do so. Why waste my energy for nothing, I thought? In grade school I learned that it wasn't for nothing, that other people had feelings too and that by talking I could make them feel something and I could feel something too. After I realized that, I tried to be friends with the boy sitting next to me at school, but he seemed to dislike me for some reason so I stopped trying. My self-esteem was very low at that point. Everybody disliked me because they thought i was too stupid. So I just kept observing them, as if they were animals at the zoo, in order to understand how they functioned. Then in 7th grade I started making friends again, after a classmate invited me to sit next to her on the first day of school. I was surprised, because the year before she ignored me. She was my first friend after a long time, and then my social circle expanded, and I was able to talk to all my classmates, and be funny and smart (because I learned how to copy the way people my age communicate). But I was fighting a battle inside. I didn't know why by I started feeling really sad. So i asked myself why. I think it was because even if I was talking, my communication seemed like a performance. All the gestures that I had to make, all the voice intonations that I had to make seemed forced, as if I was trying too hard to enteirtain my friends, because indeed I'm not really a social person. When I was social, I had to fake it so that I can appear more \"normal\". I felt different and like I was lonely in a crowd. In 8th I started to feel too overwelmed with being social, so i started to isolate myself again. I've been isolated for 90% of my life. I spent my high school years alone and depressed. I even started to believe in god because I didn't want to be alone anymore, and communicating with other people was too hard because of my depression (I didn't have the energy to do anything). But my religious phase was just that, a phase. My depression was so overwhelming that I stopped having hope and faith in a higher power. I was on the brink of killing myself. Then my teacher noticed that my grades where dropping and that I was having emotional problems (I cried in school many times) and she called my mom, and they thought I should see a therapist. Therapy didn't help so my T sent to to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with major depression. It's been 5 years since I've taken my first mental health drug. The medication benefited my mood a lot, but I still feel that the cause of my depression is that I can't communicate with others (I haven't talked to anyone since I was 13 so I lost practice). So I still feel a little bit depressed. And this, I think, can't be cured with medicine, but by going out and meeting people. The only problem is that I don't know how to start. I even feel that people in this topic are going to make fun of me. Do you have any advice for someone with poor social skills and with a ridiculously low level of self-esteem?",
      "Thats a very interesting post! Your skills in communication can not be that bad if you are able to write something like that. Maybe you could pick a hobby that includes a bit of socializing. It is not really important what it is, chess or theatre or growing pidgeons... this way you would meet people who „share the same interest“, so there would always be a topic to fall back to. During my rehab I had some „social skill“ workshops, maybe this is another option for you to make some progress. And do not let one single bad experience with therapy keep you from trying to find a supportive and understanding therapist... you seem to be well structured, I doubt there is no way to work on your issue this way. I would be happy to get a prompt from you, sorry, did not see your post earlier."

      "Hi All I have been working for a company for almost two years. Within that timeframe. I was working as a Support Worker for 19 months in a Supported Housing setting. It was the best job I ever had. Great management. Great work experience. Great rapport with staff and client's. But I guess with working career. It's only natural that after a while - you want to explore new experience and a new job up the ladder. So in April this year. I left my job for a more Specialist role. This new role was working for a different department but under the same management. Since leaving the role, they have been understaffed. Meaning extra shifts to needing cover. I wanted to maintain the link I had between my old workplace. So since I left, I have been helping out with overtime. I have helped to cover emergency sick leave. I have emailed my old manager (who is in charge of rota) and volunteered if she needs help to cover shifts. I'll do it. Two weeks ago, I worked over my hours of work that I shouldn't have done. I worked 58 hours one week and another 53 hours the following week. I bought it to my old manager's attention so she is aware. Someone previously told me it's against the law to work over 48 hours. Even this to be the case. I wanted my old manager to be aware. But I don't want her to get into trouble. And I continued to offer to work over my hours as I am 100% committed to helping out my old project. My old project remains a very special place in my heart. So since starting this new role. I have found it's not working for me. It doesn't motivate me. It's more paperwork based. You meet less with clients. Your meeting with client's perhapes on a once a month basis. Management bitch about previous employees and how they left. You spend too much time in the office. Our number of client's will be going up to 25 per colleague. This means - more paperwork and less interaction with clients. I just find it boring.  I started to feel this way on the second week. I thought I'd give it time - as it's a new role and things could change. Somehow it's been another four weeks. I am now at week 6 at my new role. I still feel the same emotions. I feel it's time to look for another job. I was even willing to work there for 6 months and then look into requesting or applying for my old job back. Anyway, I found out today another colleague is leaving my old project next month. So they are desperate and struggling with shifts to be covered. I thought this would be my perfect opportunity to request for my old job back. So I have requested to meet with my old manager tomorrow for a catch up. The only thing is - I'm scared she will decline my asking if I can come back? Since I only left 6 weeks ago. She might say it's not enough time. But I guess, with my correct reasoning - I'm hoping she will be grateful especially as she now needs cover for the extra vacant. I'm also hoping with my loyalty after I left will increase my chances with coming back. Even if she can't transfer me back. I plan on applying for the role when it goes up. Do you have any tips or advice on my meeting tomorrow and the correct reasons being diplomatic on why I want to return? Cheers",

I thought this would be my perfect opportunity to request for my old job back. Yes i think you are right So I have requested to meet with my old manager tomorrow for a catch up. Good The only thing is - I'm scared she will decline my asking if I can come back? Since I only left 6 weeks ago. She might say it's not enough time. Why? It seems to be enough to get an opinion But I guess, with my correct reasoning - I'm hoping she will be grateful especially as she now needs cover for the extra vacant. I'm also hoping with my loyalty after I left will increase my chances with coming back. Yes Even if she can't transfer me back. I plan on applying for the role when it goes up. Do you have any tips or advice on my meeting tomorrow and the correct reasons being diplomatic on why I want to return? Cheers I think you did well. I think you can say all you said here : that you really liked the job, that you tried an other one in the company that doesn't suits you. 2 things occur in my mind : - be ready to have to wait a little for the answer. Maybe she'll have to think, or maybe she'll have to ask - I don't know the company, the culture etc. About the two ways of going back there (through direct going or applying), i'd think about the most diplomatic way to present it. Maybe something like : \"i saw there will be a need for someone there and i plan to apply. But maybe it's possible to go directly too? What do you think? \" (sorry for the mistakes in reading or writing)",
      "Thank you so much for your replie. I will definitly do as you kindly advised.",
      "Hi, How was the meeting? Was it ok for you?",
      "Hi All Many thanks for your replies. I thought I'd update you. So I attended my catch up with my old manager. She greeted me and informed the team misses me. Although I haven't left as I have been doing extra overtime. She informed she is grateful. She highlighted on how much she knows that I love the project. I sat down and I was open. I told her, that I don't find the job is the right place for me. I find it less interactive with client's. I miss my old job. She was incredibly understanding. Once we established my non wanting to continue with the current job. She began smiling and asking me on whether I wanted to come back? I assured that I came today to request for my old job back. Her face lit up. I burst into tears with happiness. She began laughing. We talked about my possible start date. I assured I'd like to start asap. Where her face lit up even more. She got excited and informed my previous Team Leader will be happy. She called her into the room and excitely announced welcome your new recruit. My old Team Leader began to smile. We all had a chat and a laugh. Towards the end, my old manager focused her attention on when I return. They will focus on my self development. She talked about aiming for Team Leader. She gave me a hug before I left. I whispered, \"I'm finally coming home to my family\". My old manager has informed my current management team. Although they feel sad that I am returning. I;m just glad I took the risk. It really could have gone either way. I could have got \"nope you left us. Why should I help you?\" Instead I got their support and their welcome back. The risk was worth taking.",
      "Wow good news!! Congrats!"

      "Sorry for a kind of pointless forum I never can seem to convey an emotion other than nothingness right now and I can't talk to anyone because of the fear of losing everything. I just want to put it out in hopes of the weight of everything somewhat decreases. I never really seem to get better in terms of anything. My upbringing wasn't bad compared to most and I could have had it worse and the biggest  \"trauma\", if you could call it that, was partly due to my own inability anyway.  What I'm saying is there are people I know who've had it far worse and I don't know why I'm still so hung up on my past. I've felt this way for years, I'm an adult and it still hasn't resolved itself. I go through the worst parts of it and things mellow out before it gets worse again. If I even had the energy to pursue any ambitions I don't feel I would be able to anyway because my intelligence level isn't high enough anyway. In my spare time, I just wish something could end it soon. I'm not really portraying it well but in short, I just feel like I waiting for an ending to this life. I don't really foresee anything positive happening, I've been hoping for years now hoping for things just to come my way but it never does. I'm financially unstable, I can't stand the job I can't get out of (contract obligations), and I'm tired of it. Sorry for the negativity in the post I just feel the need to put this out in some way,"

      "My psychologist tried to diagnose me with depression a few days ago, but I didn't want to take medications so I made my symptoms sound less severe to avoid being prescribed medications. So, before you say something about self-diagnosis, just remember that I was going to be diagnosed before, but I prevented it from happening. Just at the beginning of the school year, I was fine. I had friends, liked going to parties, and did things that any teenager would do. Few months later, I started isolating myself. I didn't really enjoy being with friends anymore, so I just started ignoring them. Now, I've become more silent and emotionless. I barely talk at all anymore and even when someone tries to approach me, I push them away. Some people mistaken me for have autism or aspergers sometimes because I don't talk to people. Sometimes, I think death would make me happier than being alive, although I don't plan on committing suicide or harming myself. Sometimes, whenever I'm in a happy setting, like a party for example, I just start crying for no reason. I started to hate everyone for looking more cheerful and happier than me. The only people I don't really hate are my parents because, I mean, they have done many things for me so I have to appreciate them. I kind of started to disconnect from the world around me. I've started to fantasize a world where I can be whatever I want to be. The only thing I live for is to get a job eventually so I can have money to support my health and continue to fantasize about the world that I will never be in. The only thing that makes me happy in the real world is watching anime alone in my room. I have become more careless about taking care of myself too. I've started binging on junk food and stopped exercising. My father was also in denial when the psychologist said that I might have depression and said that I was just going through a phase and this happens to lots of teenagers. I'm 14, by the way. I know it sounds like I'm just being emo/depressed wannabe, but I'd appreciate it if some of you could take it seriously and not say how I'm some emo teenager who wants attention."

      "Terrifying, unbearable, scary, uncontrollable, confusing....these and many more words are what a survivor uses to describe how a flashback feels. Flashbacks are one of the most frightening and confusing ordeals a survivor faces after a sexual assault. And though they are frightening and feel out of control they are a healthy sign that we are ready to heal. Our minds are wonderful devices, they protect us from extreme pain and suffering, sometimes by blocking out traumatic events in our lives, but when and only when our minds know that we are ready to cope with the memories and feelings does it bring them to our attention. Many times this happens in the form of a flashback, or in a more gentle and manageable term, an involuntary reflection. Not knowing why a flashback happens makes dealing with them confusing for survivors. Emotionally loaded, flashbacks bring back feelings from the original attack. Thoughts, actions and emotions that a survivor kept repressed during their attack may be to blame for some of these vivid memories. The very fact that flashbacks seem to be uncontrollable and unpredictable, makes stopping flashback memories seemingly just another pain to bear. When we begin to understand why we have flashbacks and are not paralyzed by them, we can move further along the path to healing. Flashbacks are a natural process of healing and they are safe. Your mind is now telling you that it is no longer necessary to block such memories.",
      "More information on flashbacks Flashbacks Flashbacks are recollections from the past. They may be pictures, sounds, smells, feelings, or the lack of them (numbness). Sometimes there is no actual visual or auditory memory. You may feel panicky, or trapped, you may feel powerless without knowing why. These experiences can also happen in dreams. As a child you had to protect yourself from the emotional and physical horrors of abuse. In order to survive, that child remained locked inside, unable to express the feelings and thoughts of that time. It is as though we put that part of us into a time warp until it comes out in the present. When that part comes out, the child in you is experiencing the past as if it were happening today. As the flashback happens, it is as if you forget that you have an ‘adult’ self available for comfort, protection and grounding. The extreme feelings and body sensations occurring are so frightening because they are not related to the reality of the present and many times seem to come from out of the blue. We begin to think we are crazy and are afraid of telling anyone about what is happening. We feel out of control and at the mercy of our experiences. We begin to avoid certain areas and situations, that we think triggered it. Sometimes flashbacks occur during any form of sexual contact, or it may be a person who looks or behaves and reminds you of the person who abused you, or it may be a situation today that stirs up similar trapped feelings (confrontation, angry people). If you are feeling little... you may be experiencing a flashback. If you are having stronger feelings than you expect to have in the present situation ... you are probably having a flashback Flashbacks Are Normal Flashbacks are sometimes called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder The diagnostic category book for psychiatry defines Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as the normal experience of all people experiencing an event that is outside the range of normal human experience. Flashbacks sometimes make you feel insane because the child in you doesn't know that there is an adult survivor available to help. What Does Help? Tell yourself that you are having a flashback. Remind yourself that the worst is over. The feelings and sensations you are experiencing are memories of the past Get Grounded. This means stamping your feet on the ground so that the child knows you have feet and can get away now if you need to. (As a child, you couldn't get away........ now you can). Breathe. When we get frightened we stop normal breathing. As a result our body begins to panic because we haven’t got enough oxygen. Lack of oxygen causes a great deal of panic feelings; pounding in the head, tightness, sweating, feeling faint, shakiness, dizziness. When we breathe deeply enough, a lot of the panic feeling can decrease. Re-establish to the present. Begin to use your five senses in the present. Look around and see the colours in the room, the shapes of things, the people near, etc. Listen to the sounds in the room; your breathing, traffic, birds, people, cars etc. Feel your body and what is touching it; your clothes, your own arms and hands, the chair or floor supporting you. Talk to the child in you and tell her she is OK. It is very important that the child knows that the adult is around to take care for her. The child needs to know that it is safe to experience the feelings and let go of the past. Find your boundaries. Sometimes when we are having a flashback things get out of proportion we lose the sense of where we end and the world begins; as if we do not have skin. Wrap yourself in a blanket, hold a pillow or soft toy, go to bed, sit in a cupboard... anything that you can do to make yourself feel safe. Get help. You may need to be alone or you may want someone near you. In either case it is important that your friends and relations know about flashbacks so they can help with the process, whether that means letting you be by yourself or being there, whatever is right for you is right. Take time to regain control. Sometimes flashbacks are very powerful. Don't expect yourself to be able to do adult things immediately. Be kind and look after yourself do something that you enjoy. Don’t punish yourself, you and your child don’t deserve it. Be patient. It takes time to heal the past. It takes time to learn ways of taking care of yourself, of being an adult who has feelings and developing effective ways of coping in the here and now. Find a competent therapist. Look for a therapist who understands the process of healing from incest. A therapist can be a guide, a support, a coach in this healing process. You do not have to do it alone every again. Join a self-help group. Survivors are wonderful allies in this process of healing. It is a healing thing to share your process with others who understand so deeply what you are going through. Know you are not going mad ....... you are healing!",
      "The American Heritage Dictionary defines Flashback as: \"A recurring, intensely vivid mental image of a past traumatic experience.\" Abreaction is defined as: \"To release (repressed emotions) by acting out, as in words, behavior, or the imagination, the situation causing the conflict.\" While these are both accurate technically, they are missing some detail. A Flashback is the mind's way of dealing with a traumatic event that it was unable to make sense of when the event happened.

      "for me i noticed the trigger was often watching the news and coverage of the wars would be a trigger that illicit a physical response like heart racing and anxiety and sometimes vivid flashbacks that are more like a collage than one event.. However ive also had the same sort of symptoms at the thought of natural disaster like tornado warnings or severe weather...its hard to explain, perhaps it has something to do with adrenaline or a fight or flight response in the later. Ive never had any suicidal thoughts, just severe and intense survival responses or heart racing and anxiety when i see familiar war related images...troops in the prone, vehicles wrecked by IED, etc. Very strange thing, our mind."

In 2009, the Veterans Crisis Line added an anonymous online chat service, which has helped more than 4,000 people. In 2011, the National Veterans Suicide Prevention Hotline was renamed the Veterans Crisis Line to encourage Veterans and their families and friends to make the call. People who know a Veteran best may be the first to recognize emotional distress and reach out for support when issues reach a crisis point—and well before a Veteran is at risk of suicide.

      "A National Center for PTSD Fact Sheet The emotional effects of the recent terrorist attacks will be felt by people everywhere: victims, bereaved family members, friends, rescue workers, emergency medical care providers, mental-health care providers, witnesses to the event, volunteers, members of the media, and citizens of the community, the country, and the world. Those who were at the scene and those who have lost loved ones will almost certainly have strong reactions. People who saw or heard about the attacks on TV may also have strong reactions. Common reactions to traumatic events like the terrorist attack include feeling afraid, sad, horrified, helpless, angry, overwhelmed, confused, distracted, emotionally numb, or disoriented. People may also be bothered by nightmares or upsetting thoughts and images that come to mind. Young children may be upset, distracted, or feel out of sorts. These are normal reactions to very stressful events. With the help of family and friends, most people gradually feel better as time goes by. What can people do to cope? Spend time with other people. Coping with stressful events is easier when people support each other. If it helps, talk about how you are feeling. Be willing to listen to others who need to talk about how they feel. Get back to your everyday routines. Familiar habits can be very comforting. Take time to grieve and cry if you need to. To feel better in the long run, you need to let these feelings out instead of pushing them away or hiding them. Ask for support and help from your family, friends, church, or other community resources. Join or develop support groups. Set small goals to tackle big problems. Take one thing at a time instead of trying to do everything at once. Eat healthy food and take time to walk, stretch, exercise, and relax, even if just for a few minutes at a time. Make sure you get enough rest and sleep. People often need more sleep than usual when they are very stressed. Do something that just feels good to you like taking a warm bath, taking a walk, sitting in the sun, or petting your cat or dog. If you are trying to do too much, try to cut back by putting off or giving up a few things that are not absolutely necessary. Find something positive you can do. Give blood. Donate money to help victims of the attack. Join efforts in your community to respond to this tragedy. Get away from the stress of the event sometimes. Turn off the TV news reports and distract yourself by doing something you enjoy. What can adults do to help children cope? Let them know you understand their feelings. Tell them that they really are safe. Keep to your usual routines. Keep them from seeing too many frightening pictures of the events. Educate yourself about how to talk to children of different ages about trauma. When should a person seek more help? Sometimes people need extra help to deal with a traumatic event. People directly affected by this tragedy, young children, people who have been through other traumatic events, and people with emotional problems are more likely to need professional help. A person may need extra help coping if a month after the attack he or she: Still feels very upset or fearful most of the time Acts very differently compared to before the trauma Can't work or take care of kids or home Has important relationships that are continuing to get worse Uses drugs or drinks too much Feels jumpy or has nightmares a lot Still can't stop thinking about the attack Still can't enjoy life at all Where can one go to get help? Listed beloware some ways to find help. When you call, tell whomever you speak to that you are trying to find a mental-health provider who specializes in helping people who have been through traumatic events and/or who have lost loved ones. Check this website regularly for updated information on how to get help. We will be listing more ways to get help as they become available. For veterans VA medical centers and Vet Centers provide veterans with mental-health services that health insurance will cover or that costs little or nothing, according to a veteran's ability to pay. VA medical centers and Vet Centers are listed in the phone book in the blue Government pages.

      "Symptoms of PTSD Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition that follows a terrifying event. Often, people with PTSD have persistent frightening thoughts and memories of their ordeal and feel emotionally numb, especially with people they were once close to. PTSD, once referred to as shell shock or battle fatigue, was first brought to public attention by war veterans, but it can result from any number of traumatic incidents. These include kidnapping, serious accidents such as car or train wrecks, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, violent attacks such as a mugging, rape, or torture, or being held captive. The event that triggers it may be something that threatened the person's life or the life of someone close to him or her. Or it could be something witnessed, such as mass destruction after a plane crash. Whatever the source of the problem, some people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in the form of nightmares and disturbing recollections during the day. They may also experience sleep problems, depression, feeling detached or numb, or being easily startled. They may lose interest in things they used to enjoy and have trouble feeling affectionate. They may feel irritable, more aggressive than before, or even violent. Seeing things that remind them of the incident may be very distressing, which could lead them to avoid certain places or situations that bring back those memories. Anniversaries of the event are often very difficult. PTSD can occur at any age, including childhood. The disorder can be accompanied by depression, substance abuse, or anxiety. Symptoms may be mild or severe--people may become easily irritated or have violent outbursts. In severe cases they may have trouble working or socializing. In general, the symptoms seem to be worse if the event that triggered them was initiated by a person--such as a rape, as opposed to a flood. Ordinary events can serve as reminders of the trauma and trigger flashbacks or intrusive images. A flashback may make the person lose touch with reality and reenact the event for a period of seconds or hours or, very rarely, days. A person having a flashback, which can come in the form of images, sounds, smells, or feelings, usually believes that the traumatic event is happening all over again. Not every traumatized person gets full-blown PTSD, or experiences PTSD at all. PTSD is diagnosed only if the symptoms last more than a month. In those who do have PTSD, symptoms usually begin within 3 months of the trauma, and the course of the illness varies. Some people recover within 6 months, others have symptoms that last much longer. In some cases, the condition may be chronic. Occasionally, the illness doesn't show up until years after the traumatic event. Specific Symptoms of this Disorder: The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others and the person's response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror. The traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one (or more) of the following ways: recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections of the event, including images, thoughts, or perceptions. recurrent distressing dreams of the event. acting or feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring (includes a sense of reliving the experience, illusions, hallucinations, and dissociative flashback episodes, including those that occur on awakening or when intoxicated). intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event The individual also has persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness (not present before the trauma), as indicated by three (or more) of the following: efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with the trauma efforts to avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities feeling of detachment or estrangement from others restricted range of affect (e.g., unable to have loving feelings) sense of a foreshortened future (e.g., does not expect to have a career, marriage, children, or a normal life span) Persistent symptoms of increased arousal (not present before the trauma), as indicated by two (or more) of the following: difficulty falling or staying asleep irritability or outbursts of anger difficulty concentrating hypervigilance exaggerated startle response The disturbance, which has lasted for at least a month, causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.",
      "This is something that I learned to understand in therapy. Conditioned Memory A class of implicit memory includes behavior learned through classical conditioning (CC) or operant conditioning (OC). Either or both of them can be involved in the learned trauma responses of those with PTS and PTSD. Classical conditioning The easiest place to start is with a little example. Consider a hungry dog who sees a bowl of food. Something like this might happen: Food ---> Salivation The dog is hungry, the dog sees the food, the dog salivates. This is a natural sequence of events, an unconscious, uncontrolled, and unlearned relationship. See the food, then salivate. Now, because we are humans who have an insatiable curiosity, we experiment. When we present the food to the hungry dog (and before the dog salivates), we ring a bell. Thus, Bell with Food ---> Salivation We repeat this action (food and bell given simultaneously) at several meals. Every time the dog sees the food, the dog also hears the bell. Ding-dong, Alpo. Now, because we are humans who like to play tricks on our pets, we do another experiment. We ring the bell (Ding-dong), but we don't show any food. What does the dog do? Right, Bell ---> Salivate The bell elicits the same response the sight of the food gets. Over repeated trials, the dog has learned to associate the bell with the food and now the bell has the power to produce the same response as the food. (And, of course, after you've tricked your dog into drooling and acting even more stupidly than usual, you must give it a special treat.) This is the essence of Classical Conditioning. It really is that simple. You start with two things that are already connected with each other (food and salivation). Then you add a third thing (bell) for several trials. Eventually, this third thing may become so strongly associated that it has the power to produce the old behavior. Now, where do we get the term, \"Conditioning\" from all this? Let me draw up the diagrams with the official terminology. Food ---------------------> Salivation Unconditioned Stimulus ---> Unconditioned Response \"Unconditioned\" simply means that the stimulus and the response are naturally connected. They just came that way, hard wired together like a horse and carriage and love and marriage as the song goes. \"Unconditioned\" means that this connection was already present before we got there and started messing around with the dog or the child or the spouse. \"Stimulus\" simply means the thing that starts it while \"response\" means the thing that ends it. A stimulus elicits and a response is elicited. (This is circular reasoning, true, but hang in there.) Another diagram, Conditioning Stimulus Bell with Food -----------------------> Salivation Unconditioned Stimulus------> Unconditioned Response We already know that \"Unconditioned\" means unlearned, untaught, preexisting, already-present-before-we-got-there. \"Conditioning\" just means the opposite. It means that we are trying to associate, connect, bond, link something new with the old relationship. And we want this new thing to elicit (rather than be elicited) so it will be a stimulus and not a response. Finally, after many trials we hope for, Bell ---------------------> Salivation Conditioned Stimulus ---> Conditioned Response Operant Conditioning Operant conditioning has been widely applied in clinical settings (i.e., behavior modification) as well as teaching (i.e., classroom management) and instructional development (e.g., programmed instruction). Parenthetically, it should be noted that Skinner rejected the idea of theories of learning. 1. Practice should take the form of question (stimulus) - answer (response) frames which expose the student to the subject in gradual steps 2. Require that the learner make a response for every frame and receive immediate feedback 3. Try to arrange the difficulty of the questions so the response is always correct and hence a positive reinforcement 4. Ensure that good performance in the lesson is paired with secondary reinforcers such as verbal praise, prizes and good grades. 1. Behavior that is positively reinforced will reoccur; intermittent reinforcement is particularly effective 2. Information should be presented in small amounts so that responses can be reinforced (\"shaping\") 3. Reinforcements will generalize across similar stimuli (\"stimulus generalization\") producing secondary conditioning",
      "Defense Mechanisms We go through many, many changes as we move from infancy through childhood to adulthood. The one that came to mind for me the other day as I was holding a friend's new born baby in my arms and thinking about the psychological distance between his infant mind and my own, was a consciousness of all the personality defenses and coping strategies we learn while growing up; how important these things are for keeping us safe from the more predatory elements of our world, but also the openness we can lose as these defenses get built. Personality defenses (coping techniques, defense mechanisms) are important things in that they strongly influence the ease with which people are able to form and maintain healthy relationships and reject unhealthy relationships. Developing organically in response to frustrating, difficult and painful situations and experiences, they function as the human equivalent of a computer firewall, helping to defend against hurtful and abusive relationships, while hopefully also allowing healthy and nurturing relationships to pass. Discriminating when to be defensive and when not to be defensive is key for health. You need defense to keep you safe from those who would mess with you, but you also need to know when to relax and let your defenses down so as to retain the capability for innocence, openness and healthy relationships. Defenses are important, an immune system unto themselves. They're worth spending an essay talking about. Mapping the world and the self Becoming defensive is all about learning to identify and avoid painful and dangerous situations. We are born mostly open and undefended. We learn to avoid painful and dangerous situations by learning to map or represent (in our heads, not on paper) the world and where the dangerous, painful things exist in the world. We start doing this even as very young children and continue it with ever increasing sophistication as we mature. As our representation of the world becomes more sophisticated, our ability to control, tolerate or avoid pain also becomes similarly sophisticated. The first pains we become aware of are internal - having to do with instinctual drives such as hunger, elimination and emotion. These drives create tensions in our infant bodies that over time we learn to represent and react to. For example, we instinctually cry when we are hungry but probably can't initially distinguish the pain of hunger from other pains. Over time we learn to recognize and represent hunger pains as a distinct sort of painful signal that can be avoided by eating. More time goes by and we learn to request food, thereby cutting hunger pains off before they become compelling. This sort of self-knowledge and control is easy for adults, but it is a major learning project for infants and toddlers. In addition to mapping our internal environment, we also start mapping our external social environment. We learn, for instance, that our initial infant-centric map of the world (“It's all about me”) doesn't predict what other people will do with great accuracy. In response, we develop a social map of the people we are in relationships with and what they are likely to do for us. Our social map helps us to avoid people who are likely to hurt us and approach people who are likely to help us. As before, most adults can make this discrimination more or less easily, but children take years to properly master such discrimination. The degree to which representation or mapping of the self and the social world takes place is always in relationship with a person's developmental level. Infants and young children (who are not very developed, physically or mentally) have representations of the self and of others that are more primitive, while older children and adults tend to have more sophisticated self and other representations. A person's developmental level is influenced both by biology and by experience. Children act in childlike ways both because they are inexperienced, and because their brains are literally immature and not fully physically developed. The biological aspects of children's brain development work themselves out by the teen years, and thereafter (assuming everything else has gone well), further development and maturity is mostly a function of experience and personality. Not everyone is able to benefit from experience, however. Most everyone has probably met someone chronologically adult who functions to one degree or another in an immature, child-like and primitive way. To read more of this article click on the link below.

      "How does trauma affect relationships? Trauma survivors with PTSD often experience problems in their intimate and family relationships or close friendships. PTSD involves symptoms that interfere with trust, emotional closeness, communication, responsible assertiveness, and effective problem solving. Survivors may experience a loss of interest in social or sexual activities, they may feel distant from others, and they may be emotionally numb. Partners, friends, or family members may feel hurt, alienated, or discouraged because the survivor has not been able to overcome the effects of the trauma, and they may become angry or distant toward the survivor. Feeling irritable, on guard, easily startled, worried, or anxious may lead survivors to be unable to relax, socialize, or be intimate without being tense or demanding. Significant others may feel pressured, tense, and controlled as a result. Difficulty falling or staying asleep and severe nightmares may prevent both the survivor and partner from sleeping restfully, which may make sleeping together difficult. Trauma memories, trauma reminders or flashbacks, and the avoidance of such memories or reminders can make living with a survivor feel like living in a war zone or like living with the constant threat of vague but terrible danger. Living with an individual who has PTSD does not automatically cause PTSD, but it can produce vicarious or secondary traumatization, which is similar to having PTSD. Reliving trauma memories, avoiding trauma reminders, and struggling with fear and anger greatly interfere with a survivor's ability to concentrate, listen carefully, and make cooperative decisions. As a result, problems often go unresolved for a long time. Significant others may come to feel that dialogue and teamwork are impossible. Survivors of childhood sexual and physical abuse and survivors of rape, domestic violence, combat, terrorism, genocide, torture, kidnapping, and being a prisoner of war often report feeling a lasting sense of terror, horror, vulnerability, and betrayal that interferes with relationships. What can be done to help someone who has PTSD? Survivors who feel close to someone else, who begin to trust, and who become emotionally or sexually intimate may feel like they are letting down their guard. Although the survivor often actually feels a strong bond of love or friendship in current healthy relationships, this experience can be perceived as dangerous. Having been victimized and exposed to rage and violence, survivors often struggle with intense anger and impulses. In order to suppress their anger and impulsive actions, survivors mayaboidaaa avoid closeness by expressing criticism toward or dissatisfaction with loved ones and friends. Intimate relationships may have episodes of verbal or physical violence. Survivors may be overly dependent upon or overprotective of partners, family members, friends, or support persons (such as healthcare providers or therapists). Alcohol abuse and substance addiction, which can result from an attempt to cope with PTSD, can destroy intimacy and friendships In the first weeks and months following a traumatic event, survivors of disasters, terrible accidents or illnesses, or community violence often feel an unexpected sense of anger, detachment, or anxiety in their intimate, family, and friendship relationships. Most are able to resume their prior level of intimacy and involvement in relationships, but the 5-10% who develop PTSD often experience lasting problems with relatedness and intimacy. Yet, many trauma survivors do not experience PTSD, and many people in intimate relationships, families, and friendships with individuals who have PTSD do not experience severe relational problems. People with PTSD can create and maintain successful intimate relationships by: Establishing a personal support network that will help the survivor cope with PTSD while he or she maintains or rebuilds family and friend relationships with dedication, perseverance, hard work, and commitment Sharing feelings honestly and openly with an attitude of respect and compassion Continually strengthening cooperative problem-solving and communication skills Including playfulness, spontaneity, relaxation, and mutual enjoyment in the relationship What can be done to help someone who has PTSD? For many trauma survivors, intimate, family, and friend relationships are extremely beneficial. These relationships provide: 1. Companionship and a sense of belonging, which can act as an antidote to isolation 2. Self-esteem, which can act as an antidote to depression and guilt 3. Opportunities to make a positive contribution, which can reduce feelings of failure or alienation 4. Practical and emotional support when coping with life stressors As with all psychological disturbances, especially those that impair social, psychological, or emotional functioning, it is best to seek treatment from a professional who has expertise in both PTSD and in treating couples or families. Many therapists with this expertise are members of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, whose membership directory contains a geographical listing and an indication of those who treat couples or families and PTSD. Survivors find a number of different professional treatments helpful for dealing with relationship issues, including individual and group psychotherapy for their own PTSD, anger and stress management, assertiveness training, couples communication classes, family education classes, and family therapy.

      "Understanding Memory Storage and Recall The Fragmentary Nature of Memory Storage in Unresolved Traumas When a traumatic event occurs, we may be confronted with an overwhelming amount of information in the form of images, emotions, physical sensations, smells and sounds. It appears that under such conditions, the brain becomes overloaded with large volumes of information. The resulting neurochemical changes disrupt normal processing of this information, causing memories to be subsequently stored as fragments in their original distressing/disturbing state. These memory fragments are stored in \"associative networks\" in which related thoughts, memories, images, emotions, and sensations are linked together (Shapiro, 1995; Lang, cited in van der Kolk, 1994). For example, an adult rape survivor who has also experienced childhood sexual abuse may have memory fragments of her most recent rape experience stored together with similar memories from her earlier experience(s). Later, discussion of an aspect of one event may trigger the recall of similar aspects of the other. This can happen even in situation where the client had no recent recollection of the past trauma. In either event, further exploration may trigger the recall of additional fragments. The Accuracy of Memory Recall The retrieval of memories typically re-activates a process of wanting to make sense of the new material -- to give the memories meaning and to find the words needed to fully describe the impact that the original event had. This process can be something like putting together a jigsaw puzzle -- but without the help of the picture on the outside of the box. As more and more pieces of the \"puzzle\" become available through additional work in therapy, the client's overall understanding of what happened can change, sometimes dramatically. For this reason, an additional word of caution is well advised: For clients who first begin recovering previously repressed memories (especially if this occurs PRIOR to the completion of much of their therapeutic work), it can be a big temptation to trust one's first attempt to \"fit\" the pieces together and (in the case of some human-perpetrated traumas) confront the perpetrator(s). Consider the client who recalled in treatment having been sexually abused as a child. Among her initial memory fragments she recovered one that was an image of her father's face and assumed him to have been the perpetrator. Later, after more work in therapy, she recalled additional pieces of the puzzle and realized that the image of her father was from when he had come to her rescue and that the perpetrator had been someone else. This example illustrates the importance of delaying any confrontations of perpetrators until the bulk of your therapeutic work has been completed and you have had plenty of opportunity to seek corroborating evidence that supports the story you construct using recalled memories. It is very difficult to know whether one's memories are accurate representations of past traumas. There are several different types of information that may be later retrieved during therapeutic work. In addition to memory fragments that are experienced by the client as having an accurate resemblance to the original trauma, there may be fragments of dreams that were symbolic of emotional conflicts, screen memories (memories that defensively cover up more distressing details of the same event), memories that are distorted by the client's desire to see the situation (or individual in it) in a different light, memories of trauma(s) witnessed by the client that actually happened to someone else, and memories that are vague or distorted due to dissociative defense used to cope during the trauma. It is important to know that mental health professionals cannot validate the historical truth of any memory. This is one of the limitations of psychotherapy and validation is something you would have to establish for yourself with independent corroboration. This information is also not meant to discount the impact of your suffering nor to suggest that you not discuss the material that emerges in your treatment. These recollections (despite the issue of accuracy) are what shape self-esteem, influence behavior, and provide meaning and perspective for one's life. Trauma & Memory",
      "Triggers and Desensitization \"Throughout the course of a day your senses and perceptions take in an enormous amount of data which they correlate and then translate into reactions. These reactions may be in the form of thoughts, words, actions, or beliefs. Every reaction an individual has is totally based on past experience or experiences that the individual's mind correlate as being as close to the current situation as possible. Reactions can change as the focus of the individual's thoughts and concerns change. As an individual recovers their abusive history, their focus is changed and subsequently their reactions are also changed. Triggers are words, symbols, situations, items, sounds, smells, colours just about anything that the mind correlates to a negative past experience and causes a reaction based on it. As an individual's focus changes, things that once did not cause them to react, now do. However, the reverse is also true. As the individual comprehends these triggers and integrates a new meaning of them into their perceptions OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING, then what was once a trigger is no longer. It is a simple as that, however, the practicing can take some time, dedication and determination on the part of the survivor. Even triggers that are part of a programmed response for a survivor are defused under essentially the same principle. Part of what makes dealing with triggers so difficult is in determining what the trigger is exactly. Some survivors hace a delayed reaction to some triggers. Triggers can also be cumulative in nature. For instance, a survivor encounters three distinct or dominant sounds over a two day period that exactly match the sounds experienced from the past. No reponse or even cognitive recognition may occur for the first two sounds, but at the third one, the survivor has a distinct reaction. It is difficult for the survivor to retrieve the first two sounds and may therefore not connect that the third sound was the final part of the trigger, especially if there were many other things occurring at the same instant that the third sound went off. The survivor may be looking to one of those rather than at the sound. For instance the third sound may have been a buzzer on the microwave or alarm clock, which the survivor hears on a regular basis without any negative reaction at all. But, that same buzzer in connection with two other preceding sounds made the cumulative stimuli into a trigger creating a notable reaction. In order for a survivor to begin determining what is triggering them, they must listen to their body sensations and responses. Even at the first sound the survivor might have felt their stomach tighten, felt a brief moment of switching (as their mind was logging the sound) or felt a flash of emotion (such as anxiety or fear). It may have lasted only for a second but because the survivor did not note or recognize what their body was trying to tell them, the event passed without being dealt with....a survivor, multiple or not, never thinks says or does or believes ANYTHING without a reason. It does not matter the degree, type or longevity of the abuse survived, just any survivor. That makes up the majority of humans living on the face of the earth. If a survivor will listen to their body realizing that there IS a reason why it is doing or feeling what it is, then they can begin the process of desensitization and deprogramming. It is the first and most crucial step in both processes. Look at how much time you, as a survivor, multiple or not, spend on your own practicing new coping skills and mechanisms or how much time you spend getting in touch with your body that your level of committment begins to show. Take a few minutes to write beside each of the following things in this list how much time per week you spend on them. It does no good to deceive yourself or increase the true amount. It is time to get honest with yourself about your survival. Do not answer on a 'per average week' basis. How much time did you spend LAST WEEK on the following things. You may find it helpful to keep a running track from week to week so taht you are allotting the time that is required to effectively meet the responsibilites to yourself and your survival. How Much Time Did You Spend This Week On: 1. Learning a totally new coping skill? ______________ 2. Practising a totally new coping skill? ______________ 3. Getting in touch with your body sensations through massage or other means? ______________ 4. Being consciously aware of your body signals? ______________ 5. Learning about your current coping skills? ______________ 6. Preparing, through various types of journalling or mapping, for your next therapy session? ______________ 7. Discovering why, what, and who inside your Unit/system reacted to a certain situation in a certain way? ______________ 8. Why you were feeling depressed, angry or any other feeling(s) in a specific situation, past or present? ______________ 9. Letting your various child components (if multiple) or inner child side (if non-multiple) out to do something they wanted to do? ______________ 10. Direct open-minded communication with your child components or inner child side? ______________ 11. Direct interaction with your child components or your inner child side? (The adult being with the children or adult side with the child inside, playing, singing, or doing a project TOGETHER? ______________ 12. Giving yourself and/or your components positive affirmations and/or comments? ______________ 13. Giving yourself and/or your components positive reinforcement by looking at a situation that might have been difficult or negative and looking for the good or positive? _______________ If your answer is you didn't have time, take a look for a moment at how much time you spent in a state of crisis or dysfunction. Taking a little extra time to work on the things in the list above will reduce the amount of time you spend in crisis and dysfunction...The degree to which you take responsibility and make conscious choices is the degree to which your life will by yours again. Once you start listening to your body you will start unravelling the 'trigger mystery'. Then what? In some cases, simply recognizing what the trigger was taht caused a certain response, then discovering what past experience or experiences the trigger(s) is correlating to, will release the significance. I call it association defusing. Associating A: the trigger + B: the experience = C: realization and defusion of the trigger. This is especially true of non-programmed trigger reponses. For the majority of survivors, association with perhaps a little therapy around the recalled experience will end the significance and power of the trigger(s). There is no set group of triggers that are universal to all or the majority of survivors, programmed or not. Triggers can also be calender dates, celestial conditions and/or major holidays. Survivors need to be especially careful that they do not set up (consciously or unconsciously) a response to a trigger because they learn that other survivors with seemingly similar histories or stories, react to that trigger. Reaction to a predisclosed trigger DOES NOT validate your memories. Nor does the way in which you react validate your memories. You must validate your own memories and experiences. For programmed survivors (survivors who hae been purposefully and methodically conditioned to repond in a specific way to a specific trigger) the solution is a little more complex and time consuming. Trigger responses of a programmed nature have a sequential life of their own. They have a pattern and a chain of psychological and/or physiological reactions that take place. The survivor must unravel not only A: what the trigger is, B: what the experience(s) is, but also C: what the instructions were, D: who gave the instructions [if not name of individual then the perceived significance of the individual or voice] E: what were the ramifications, either realized or perceived, to not giving the proper reaction, all before the survivor can fully comprehend how it equals to F: the trigger response. I do not recommend that a programmed survivor attempt to go through this process without the assistance of a trained and qualified therapist. It is extremely easy to lose touch with reality as a programmed survivor and in many cases, you can be actually reinforcing the programming rather than defusing or at least disarming it. In order to totally defuse the trigger response a survivor must complete the aforementioned equational steps, however, the survivor can begin desensitization to the trigger which will disarm it temporarily while working on defusing. It is important that you do not leave a programmed trigger in the disarmed state. If a cult perpetrator wished to reactivate a programmed trigger response that has only been disarmed it is a relatively simple procedure. Just because a survivor no longer reacts to a trigger does not necessarily imply that they have discovered and are cognizant of why it triggered then in the first place. Desensitization Desensitization involves establishing a new more desirable conditioned response to a trigger. In other words, changing the old trigger to a new one. As you can see, it does not mean that the survivor no longer responds to the trigger. What it does mean is that they respond in a different and hopefully more positive and productive way of their own choosing. I caution survivors to take an active role in determining what that new response should be. Only you can determine if it is actually more positive and productive internally. Desensitization typically takes the form of subjecting the survivor to a known trigger in a controlled, supportive environment in longer and longer periods of time until they are able to respond with the new, preestablished response. Then they are exposed to the trigger under less controlled circumstances with the survivor's normal environment while still accompanied by a support person until they are able to respond with the new response. The final step is to have the survivor experience the trigger under normal circumstances with a normal environmental setting until they can respond with the new response. The final step is to have the survivor experience the trigger under normal circumstances within a normal circumstances within a normal setting until they are able to repond with the new response. When they are capable of doing the final step, they should be able to encounter the trigger in any situation and use the new response that has been made instinctual by the above outlined process. This is the technique of many phobia experts. It can be a rather long and drawn out process depending upon the determination of the survivor to change the trigger response and how ingrained or habitual the old trigger has become. There are no true shortcuts for successful desensitization. Many therapists and survivors skip steps here and there or stop after the first time the new response is used. Other trigger responses, usually programmed, that could require initial desensitization are self-mutilative acts, suicidal acts, homicidal acts, reporting a person to a cult programmer or perpetrator, sexual acts, eating habits and so forth\".",
      "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that a person may develop after experiencing or witnessing an extreme, overwhelming traumatic event during which they felt intense fear, helplessness, or horror. The dominant features of posttraumatic stress disorder are emotional numbing (i.e., emotional nonresponsiveness), hyperarousal (e.g., irritability, on constant alert for danger), and reexperiencing of the trauma (e.g., flashbacks, intrusive emotions). Posttraumatic stress disorder is also referred to as shell shock or battle fatigue (when describing the disorder in combat veterans) and as postrape syndrome. Trauma A trauma is an intensely stressful event during which a person suffers serious harm or the threat of serious harm or death or witnesses an event during which another person (or persons) is killed, seriously injured, or threatened. Traumatic events are commonly classified as follows: Abuse Mental Physical Sexual Verbal (i.e., sexual and/or violent content) Catastrophe Harmful and fatal accidents Natural disasters Terrorism Violent attack Animal attack Assault Battery and domestic violence Rape War, battle, and combat Death Explosion Gunfire Types of PTSD There are three types of PTSD: acute, chronic, and delayed onset. In acute PTSD, symptoms last less than 3 months. In chronic PTSD, symptoms last 3 months or more. In delayed onset PTSD, symptoms first appear at least 6 months after the traumatic event. Incidence and Prevalence Lifetime prevalence is at least 1% and may be as high as 15% in the U.S. population. A National Comorbidity Survey conducted in the early 1990s found that women are twice as likely as men to experience PTSD. In high-risk groups, such as combat veterans and victims of violent crimes, prevalence ranges from 3% to 58%. PTSD is more prevalent among war veterans than among any other group. The National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Survey reports that approximately 25% of U.S. veterans, men and women, were suffering from PTSD in the early 1990s. Men with PTSD identify combat and witnessing someone else's injury or death most often as the cause of their condition. Women identify physical attack or threat most often as the cause of their PTSD. Someone with PTSD is at risk for developing other mental health disorders such as panic disorder, phobias, major depressive disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. PTSD commonly occurs in countries where long-term war, widespread social upheaval, and frequent natural disasters are prevalent. Mental Health Channel"

      "Hi all, I'd be grateful for any advice anyone can offer.  The loneliness epidemic is very real, made worse by how uncivilized times are in the 2020s.  I turn 40 this year and by my age most people have spouses or partners and are caring for children and aging parents and sick family members, plus already have their friendship circles set.  Few have the time or emotional resources to welcome a new person into their lives, which I totally understand.  But it leaves people like me to continue with a lifetime of isolation.  Adding further to it is an extensive trauma history.  Relationships have been the source of so much pain, and opening up has gotten me traumatized or ignored.  Sometimes people have felt uncomfortable learning about what has happened and just not known how to respond, or too often they just don't care.  To me, cold callous disregard hurts worse than deliberate, malicious harm.  I've learned to appreciate the safety and peace of being on my own but the loneliness still hurts too.  I know there are worse things because I've experienced them.  I just feel like I've tried so many different options, like MeetUp (even starting my own groups at significant expense), taking classes, volunteering, involvement with causes, social media, pets, online support groups, etc.  The experiences have been empty at best, retraumatizing at worst.  My only standard is not destructive.",

I can't do small talk, and am often described as \"intense\". It does hurt and it feels like were are being punished twice. Sorry for the delay. This place is quiet and I have been on the road.",
      "Thanks, Terry.  I totally agree: it's almost like we learn a different foundational language and struggle to learn the mainstream one once we're adults.  There are so many experiences and outlooks that we just don't have in common with those who haven't experienced trauma, especially childhood trauma.    Part of me doesn't want to speak about my experiences because I don't want to harm an innocent worldview grounded in safety and love.  Once you understand what depths of callousness and depravity some human hearts are capable of, it's impossible to see the world in the same way again.  I don't want to perpetuate the cycles of harm that my own family of origin did. I'm lousy at small talk, too.  When I was younger, people tended to use me as a free counselor.  Now that I'm older a lot of people seem to be a little intimidated by me though I'm not sure why; I'm actually kinder and calmer now than I was then.  But they won't usually confide in me anymore.  I just try to make use of everything, positive and negative, to be a better leader in the workplace.  I'm still looking for things outside work to take part in.",

My lack of conversational Australian English did not hurt me with them. Other thing was about 24 years ago I was in a MacDonalds when it was violently robbed. I was calm and just kept eating while everyone was screaming and diving on the floor.

It's genuinely impossible for us to respond to anything in the same way.  It's so wonderful that you and your wife found each other.  I hope the brothers-in-law can find peace and stability in time, in our out of relationships.

I'm trying to move on from it but every time I see people in pain, even if it's just on TV or in a video game it all just comes flooding back to me and I panic and I need to sleep it off. I'm not resiliant any more. I can barely watch shows for adults any more without skipping around. It's just so hard. The other day I was playing a video game and I was fine while I was fighting monsters but the second I fought a human enemy and I heard the pain grunts and everything I just shut down and I was too low to even go to sleep that night. I had to take sleeping pills. I am working with my therapist but I don't know, it's hard as I do have my breathing techniques and I do try to do distraction stuff, I play connections every day, I try to have music on, stuff like that. It's just with my other trauma history and with my DID and sutff it's like any time I get seriously freaked out I become little. and it's so embarassing having a little girl version of you be mentally stronger than the supposed grown up. I just want to be able to not get freaked out by pain I guess"

      "At the time of writing this it’s been almost a week ago that I challenged myself to permanently overcome my life-long fear of shocking imagery showing death. Last summer I watched a notorious video of a man being tortured to death, and though I initially thought it didn’t traumatise me the following months would have almost daily thoughts about the videos contents reappear in my mind, yet aside from disturbing me they didn’t truly seem to interfere with my psychological well-being. Nevertheless, I wanted to get rid of this sensitivity regardless and so chose to watch the video two more times as a form of exposure therapy. Coming across comments online that argued there are way worse videos, I couldn’t restrain myself from extending this experiment to include these as well. I looked up these videos the next day and they depicted the most horrific acts of torture i've ever seen, and realising how much this shocked me, immediately decided to repeatedly watch these videos to desensitise myself to them. The least shocking of the two I watched about 4 times, and the one that shocked me the most I watched 10 times in a row. All in all, it may have been 45 minutes to a little over an hour of exposure in total. I don’t want to go into the details for the sake of ensuring nobody looks these up for themselves, but the videos are often recognised to be among the worst gore to be found on the internet. The hours after this were characterised by a complete inability to concentrate, nausea (extending into the day after), and a feeling of being stuck in a nightmare. Depression, which I virtually never have, set in not long afterwards, perhaps partly as a result of the adrenaline crash. I felt an overwhelming urge to contact friends and family to tell them how much I loved them, which I ended up doing. From this point on I decided to take up breathing meditation twice a day while forcing myself to think about the videos to come to terms with them. Initially I thought I was feeling better the next day, yet the following days were characterised by symptoms that i can’t help but to read as indicators of something being genuinely wrong. Periods of overwhelming sorrow and demoralisation alternate with almost random periods of feeling basically normal, which both can last hours. My heart feels continuously heavy inside my chest, and a sense of nausea sometimes re-emerges for a while. Surprisingly enough, my appetite has not been significantly reduced and i generally have been sleeping well. However, yesterday evening i almost had a panic attack out of nowhere, something i've never had before. A sudden sense of impending doom, increased trouble breathing, increased heart-rate, and the videos reappearing in my mind. Slow breathing kept it from becoming worse and it eventually ebbed away (with a hint of this feeling returning at night after i tried to go back to sleep after using the bathroom at around 5AM), but i was close to losing control. This is what inspired me to seek contact with people who might have some insight into the extend to which shocking videos can screw with your brain, and whether the symptoms I’m experiencing fall under a normal response that can be sat out as my mind slowly processes what it has experienced (due to the experience merely dealing with imagery and not with actual lived experience), or are possible signs of something more serious that would require professional help.",
      "( Moderator note : Moved to PTSD- Terry, if you think it doesn't belong in PTSD, feel free to kick this back to Anxiety Disorders, I'd suggest Panic Disorder if you think it don't belong in PTSD or one of its subforums.  Edited to add this might also wind up in OCD.  Let me know what you think) Hello and welcome- as noted, I've kicked this over to PTSD- for the time being.  The PTSD moderator, Terry, might think otherwise but in the meantime we'll go with your working thread title. I don't consider myself overly sensitive to disturbing videos- any time YT shows a splash screen warning me the video I'm trying to watch may be disturbing, I grunt 'not likely' and watch it.  But then, I'm a grumpy old man. Having said that...

I'm afraid my kneejerk reaction was that I think I'd ask about professional help for feeling compelled to intentionally seek those out in the first place. I mean, I get it.  I think.  None of us get off this planet alive.  I have a fear of death, I am in the statistically last decade or two of my life and I don't freaking want to be here, I want to be in 1980.  But I'm not.  I'm at that age where I could literally die of all sorts of things, all at once.  I don't like it. But I'm not going to stick my nose in it, either.  I rarely watch anything about end of life because, well, I just don't want to go there.  I'm not avoidant- I mean, my funeral is already paid for and I have a resting place, I've had a burial plot since I was in my 20s, because I knew where I wanted to end up.  So it's not denial, it's just that I don't see the utility in intentionally exposing myself to something I really don't want to think about. I also choose not to dwell on the horrible things Man does to their fellow man.  I know there are bad people, and I leave it at that and pray I never am near the kind of person that would torture another. I'm sure there are videos that are shocking enough to disturb me to some extent.  But I choose to leave them be.  That would have been my choice, but given that the horse has already left the barn... Panic attacks suck, don't they?  I would get them from my twenties up to close to thirty.  I was able to (mostly) rid them from my life, by taking the stance that it's a mind game.  But for me, it was faced by forcing myself to go to the typical surroundings that triggered them.  Which were perfectly innocuous places- the mall, a crowded event, even church.  I personally don't know that it's healthy to watch more of those videos.  THAT... is going to be up to a professional to say whether ERP is warranted.  However, a part of my beating my panic attacks was to decide I wasn't going to let them run my life.  I had to stop caring if they happened.  From my place, anyway- I have OCD and from an OCD perspective it seems to me that something like a panic attack can be like a positive feedback loop if you let it get inside your head. Heck, now that I mention it- there are some very OCD aspects to this.  Terry, if you think PTSD isn't the place for this, we might consider OCD forum.  In retrospect, this is just the kind of thing a person with OCD, and obsessing over gore/snuff/torture, might do.  Usually, with a lot of OCD themes, a person will expose themselves to it because they have a fear of 'being into' the thing feared, or being the kind of person that would do the things in the images.  The most common OCD theme in the OCD forum, by far, is pedophilia.  Someone obsessing over that in an OCD manner will worry obsessively that they're that feared thing, even though in reality they're the furthest thing from it, and they'll intentionally seek out, if not actual CP, images of minors in order to 'test' themselves, while they're hyperaware of every response their mind and body have, and their anxiety will always twist the results to feed that fear.  Testing is always a Bad Thing, and it never resolves the obsessive fear.  So... if you tell me you have a fear of doing the kinds of things you watched, or that you're even just obsessed and fearful that you're the kind of person that wants to watch those things, then we're moving this to OCD I think.  Because watching the videos will in that case be Testing, and a very OCD kind of thing to do.  People with OCD love to 'test' themselves.  Fortunately for me, that's a trap I've never fallen into- not consciously, at least.  I do have a long history of harm-related intrusive thoughts, but resolve them in ways that don't involve giving into the temptation to 'test' myself with explicit violent imagery/stories.  I'm not sure if I've seen a poster in OCD who has Harm OCD, saying they intentionally watch videos like that, or read/watch things about real-life violent crime.  Usually, to my knowledge, we just avoid anything that could be construed as a weapon and want to crawl into a hole away from our potential 'victims'.  But OCD is a damn clever and imaginative disorder, and I could totally see someone with Harm OCD testing themselves with disturbing imagery. Barring OCD, however.. I really do think that if you can't bounce back from this, one thing in addition to treatment for the anxiety is going to be looking into what compelled you to intentionally expose yourself to disturbing imagery and concepts.  If there's something lying deeper that caused you to do that, then that ought to be resolved so that it ceases to compel you to punish yourself with such videos."

      "Hey I just had to cut a “friend” off due to bullying and sexual harassment and I couldn’t do it anymore because of my mental health suffering. And now I feel guilt, I experience flashbacks, I have trust issues now and paranoia  etc. but the number one troubling symptom is sudden onset of depression. I was fine earlier and then the depression just came back. It just came on all of the sudden. It feels like a dark cloud just came on all of a sudden.  I’m on seroquel for voices and Zoloft for anxiety and I’m in therapy but I was just wondering if this was a symptom you guys have possibly experienced now. Thank you all in advance for listening and responding",
      "Hey there, Sorry to hear what happened with your friend. I don't think I've ever had a relationship break up without feeling at least a little depressed afterwards. You feel hurt, wronged, and like any hopes you had for that friendship are gone so you experience loss too. It's entirely expected for you to feel down and even depressed. The longer the relation lasted, the longer it takes to get over it. Even if that relationship was abusive in any way. So you're definitely not alone in this. I think everyone has experienced this once if not several times in their lives. Just try and keep your mind of off things. Meet with other friends if you can, go to sleep at a regular time and keep yourself busy. Soon enough, you'll feel better. Take care, ~ Grey",
      "Emotional trauma can manifest in many ways, and it's different for everyone. If you're experiencing symptoms that you think might be related, it's valid to explore that possibility."

      "Does anyone else mentally regress into a childlike state when reminded of their trauma? Now I don't always act like a child when having a flashback, usually I just sit there or whatever and have a flashback and feel numb, but there are times where for some reason I act like a child, not a full blown child though, I don't babble or have tantrums or anything but I just act \"childish\". For example, I will hold a blanket and even maybe obsessively rub it or something, rock back and forth, etc. I have never been like this before, ever since I went through traumatic experiences, there are times where I act childish. But it's kind of an \"obsessive\" kid, maybe like really really young due to the repetitive behavior I tend to display. It's weird. I don't have multiple personalities but it's like another me, a younger me. I have other sides to myself as well but I won't get into that here. I just feel like the only one. Am I the only one?",

What you have described has a pattern I am well familiar with, and it has been know for a very long time, but not sure the cause that I know of will apply to your case. I'm 21. I've had some childhood trauma, but the biggest was when I was a teenager. My trauma is seen as \"not that extreme\" to others but it has affected me to the point of being on disability. I was bullied 6 years ago in middle school. (Around 15 years of age.) It started 6 years ago, and reoccurred 4 years ago in high school. I may get into it in another post but this is specifically about mental regression, not about going into detail about my trauma. But things before that was being physically abused by a vice principal, my mom getting into a car crash but survived, and my dad getting Lyme disease, like I said this is of course me as a child. I won't go into any more detail, but that is the quick detailed icing on the cake. I don't see why getting abused and bullied has to do with this childhood behavior. Something else off topic, I have an over exaggerated startle response now, yet like I said my trauma has nothing to do with noise. Hmm. I'm still not over it. Like I said, I usually just day dream of the flashbacks and go numb, but I do act like a child at times.",
      "I only ever had any sense of Flashback and it was \"feelings\", even sensations on my body, but never mental images. This was caused by being around the person involved. I would suggest now that I would find it near impossible to enter my family's home where I grew up. I am highly functioning very successful in business honest and highly ethical, with only a few quirks, that are basically well managed. Only my wife and children are aware of my issues. But if I ever had to enter that house again, I may shut down and go DID. Actually as I got older driving by the house I never looked and that was deliberate. We now live an hour away. My wife was also abused so moving away from our home area was not a bad idea. Actually of the 5 children from those two marriages we all moved away, many a long way. Says something. In situations that have triggered me badly (like being assaulted in a Robbery I was DID, and very calm and in control just unemotional. What you have described occurs in children who suffered extreme abuse over very long periods when very young. I mean extreme, and for years and years. As adults they sometimes are reversed how they act and feel. In your case sorry, I have not much for you.",
      "I have images in my head all the time. Wish I could function. I relate to \"not so good\" people, people who \"failed\" in life, etc. Hmm. I've been in therapy ever since I was little and the professionals did very little to help me. There must be help for people like me, I don't want to take a wrong turn, I don't want to believe in the stereotype of people like me ending up in a bad spot because we are loners of the world and such and such. You know the stories. The last mental health facility kept on passing me from doctor to doctor. I found out I wasn't the only one who had this issue, for one of my family members also went to that facility and had the same problem. I look at the google reviews for that local mental health facility place and it has a lot of bad reviews. They say \"treating the untreatable\" because of my mental and personality issues. I just want to get \"fixed.\" I just want to trust people and be happy while I'm still young. I just want to relax.",
      "I do this. I tend to want to sit on the floor, and tug on either my clothing or hair like I'm holding someone's hand. I will be very quiet, and answer everything with little squeak/grunts. If I talk, it'll be in a more childlike voice. This is extremely odd for me as I am not a very quiet person, however most abuse I went through was when I was a child. When I'm in this state, I'll often find myself on sites like imgur, where I can keep clicking next and not have to think as much but at the same time be distracted.",
      "Yes. I have a lot of experience with this. I have been an age regressor for many years. Before I knew what it was I found the online community of adult babies. Which was good and bad, as some of it fit but some just made me more confused. But now I got to know my little side very well and how to take care of her. Letting her play and giving her everything a real baby would have. Multiple personalities is now called dissociative identity disorder and that is one type of littles."

      "(Sorry that this is long.) About 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with BPD right after some serious trauma where I thought I was going to be killed by my ex and there was rape and what was almost kidnapping/holding me hostage. I had to go along with whatever he wanted because I was scared. When I was diagnosed, I didn't understand yet I had been through trauma, but I was later diagnosed with PTSD after I did. I also didn't understand that at the other time of my life when BPD symptoms showed, I was going through trauma. Like at 14 when I started cutting and acting out, I had just been molested and also a victim of child porn. I have had several other traumatic experiences throughout life too, some worse than others. What struck me about the BPD label was the way people interpreted me and a lot of what I've read about it... I occasionally struggle with romantic relationships, yes, and my emotions can be hard for people (and me) at times. I went through a rebellious, \"empty\" phase where everything lost meaning. When I get triggered, (usually related to trauma,) my anxiety and fear put me in fight or flight mode. But a lot of my relational difficulties are more like C-PTSD than BPD. It's usually a fight or flight response. I avoid people like crazy because I'm scared of being too much. The interpretation of BPD as \"evil\" has had me constantly questioning myself and trying to better myself, nobody who really knows me thinks I'm evil. I'm usually the one to end relationships out of fear and I just do not trust people,  and... So many things people say about BPD just don't seem to be accurate. The biggest thing is that most of my BPD-like symptoms relate to traumatic experiences, not my personality... which isn't BPD-like at all if I'm not triggered. As far as I've read, the difference between C-PTSD and that is the first relates to trauma. I guess too, all the material on C-PTSD is compassionate and helpful, making me believe I can change and get better with hard work. What I read on BPD accuses me of basically being a monster that's evil and can't change because it's my personality, it makes me want to die and feel like I shouldn't be alive because I'll always be a terror and that's the last thing I want. I want to help people and have healthy relationships and be good to people... I want to believe i can heal and I think the C-PTSD label is so much more helpful. I really believe it's more accurate, I don't want to feel hopeless. Has anyone with C-PTSD ever been misdiagnosed?",
      "Welcome Answer is yes, and I guess I am not alone. My wife was a non practicing Pysch Grad who strongly believed I was BP, and it was hard to argue as my mother certainly is. But what was manic was a workaholic coping mechanism and what was depression was simply working to exhaustion. Another thing to consider is that for many of us who have suffered trauma, the PTSD does not show strongly until we are caught up in another trauma. We then seem to have a higher than normal reaction to the second trauma. A sort of compound effect. Looking at what you described I suggest you consider looking at that first trauma again against what the PTSD markers are. take care",

But what was manic was a workaholic coping mechanism and what was depression was simply working to exhaustion. you're not alone! i'm the same. i used to be a workaholic/perfectionist/overachiever and then i would burnout and end in depression. the cycle has happened several times in my life. the best i can figure out, the hypomania like qualities encourage bad sleep and eating habits, not to mention poor life decisions, that creates chronic stress and it it pushes me into depression like episodes. so, how is it really not a bipolar? i'm thinking the distinction is mostly semantic. i used to believe bipolar has a more biologic underpinnings, but i'm not sure anymore. i actually take low dose mood stabilizing meds and they help a bit. but the way my mood can take a rapid swing down to dangerous levels due to a reaction to specific triggers makes me convinced it's a complex trauma indeed. There is a great similarity to borderline too. and if i engaged in physical self harm, i would qualify for BPD.",
      "[quote=\"ddreamer\") so, how is it really not a bipolar? i'm thinking the distinction is mostly semantic [/quote] I am a self taught researching survivor that throws out a lot of the PHD research material as c@#P. Bi polar if often associated with periods of mania in which bad decisions are made. A workaholic has periods of exhaustion working on adrenaline when bad decisions are made. The first you can medicate and get a better outcome. The second just needs rest. I could go on as there are many more distinctions but they are the main ones. Again I have no qualifications except I lived with a BP and am a workaholic, also from my own experience their is sometimes/often narcissistic behaviour in BP.",
      "so, how is it really not a bipolar? i'm thinking the distinction is mostly semantic With respect, OP is not talking about bipolar, BPD= borderline personality disorder. Cptsd is commonly misdiagnosed as bpd as it's a pretty new category. While there are similarities they are distinct diagnosis. As far as I've read, the difference between C-PTSD and that is the first relates to trauma Actually bpd is also caused by trauma. The main differences as far as I understand it are, people with BPD are motivated by fear of abandonment while in cptsd the motivation is fear of being hurt. People with BPD have an unstable sense of self, while in cptsd people usually have a stable but negative sense of self, and in BPD people have unstable relationships and inconsistent attachment style, while in cptsd the attachment style is more avoidant and people are more likely to want to be alone as it feels safer."

      "The other night I was awake almost the entire night having nightmares, night terrors, and panic attacks. I'm on Prazosin but it doesn't always work. I know it's because I started reading books about Narcissistic and Sociopathic abuse. I finally have vocabulary words, concepts, and an understanding of what I endured with family, ex-romantic partners, and even ex-friends. I'm a magnet for these kinds of people because I am an HSP and empath. I feel like I constantly have to have walls up just to protect myself from these kinds of people. It's very difficult for me to associate love, family, and friendship with positive thoughts and feelings, and it's hard for me to trust people. I carry a lot of grief inside from these wounds of betrayal, abuse, neglect, and emotional abandonment. No matter how hard I try to heal, find closure, or let go and move on, I feel stuck. I should say, I've found peace with a lot of my ex-partners and friends, but when it comes to family, it's a lot harder to let that one go. A lot harder to forgive. That's where I am really struggling, with my family. I have done a lot of healing with everyone else. Right now, I have no one to talk to, and a million thoughts in my head, trying to process recent and past traumas. I don't currently have a therapist, it's a waiting list issue. Is anyone else here a Survivor of this type of abuse and what has helped you? What are your thoughts about forgiving and moving on?"

      "So a while back, someone here said EMDR can sometimes be contraindicated in people with cPTSD because they experience a lot of dissociation. I've been asking around, and now I have some extra questions. I was told elsewhere the reason why it increases dissociation is because people with severe trauma already have a very narrow therapeutic window (between hyperawarenes and hypoawareness/dissociative states) - and the EMDR process would have to be very closely monitored or else the \"window\" gets even narrower for the individual to the point of extremes ^ Please correct me if I'm understanding that wrong. Also, if anyone here experienced the whole narrowing thing leading to a drastic increase in dissociation from anything, how long did it take for you to return to your baseline? And what did you find helped? I took the following from another post in this subforum \" ... emotional fragments, but they wouldn't be developed to the point where they would have their own thoughts and opinions. \" ^ What would these emotional fragments do then? Lastly, if anyone is comfortable with it, what types of psychosis do you experience from your PTSD or cPTSD?",
      "I don't know how the emdr is going to affect me. Yesterday my the psychologist did a dissociative personality test on me and it came back that I do have symptoms. She told me that because of this I will need to have a lot of work done before I have the emdr so that's all I know.",
      "That's awesome that she knows about that. It's been new info for me, and even though I never suggest people to work on their actual trauma, I have mentioned it as a way of coping with triggers. I hope I haven't ###$ anyone up (including myself) If you guys ever discuss psychosis in dissociation and cPTSD or if you find things that help and you ever feel like posting it, I'd value it.",
      "Yeah I reckon she knows her stuff. She said that because it sounds like I've got different personalities and that some are protectors then the emdr may have to be postponed for a while because one of these protectors will stop me from remembering the trauma. It's complex stuff when you think about it.",
      "It is extremely complex stuff. So then I wonder if she thinks you have DID Do you recognize your different personalities?",
      "She hasn't said its DID. She calls them different parts. She's talking about getting to know them so that'll be interesting. I kind of do recognise them but only when I realise that one of them has done something or behaved in a certain way and I just have absolutely no connection to the event. I can remember it but its as if someone else has done it and I can't imagine being like that. It's like someone might tell me about myself and I'll deny being like that because at the time I'm not that person and the person who they're talking about is completely separate.",
      "Thank you for the reply",
      "I don't really have any useful information for you, but I am following this thread now because I am sort of in a similar boat. CPTSD with dissociation. I've been considering EMDR for a while now. Apparently I came on this board last summer and asked some questions about it, though I was surprised when I saw that today, because I can't remember doing that.",
      "I have been diagnosed with CPTSD, Anxiety, BPD and depression.  I have managed these in my life, unfortunately, through various addictions to help me \"get out of my head.\"   I am on god knows how many meds to help, which it really doesn't except to take the edge slightly off.  My dissociation is around sex abuse when I was a child.  I have slipped into it when highly stressed and go into self-harm behaviors. I am doing EMDR now and for me, it has been a godsend.  It helps me understand how this event, lead to that, and why I think how I think.   But it also has helped take the constant focus on those events away. I haven't had any side effects in terms of disassociation, the therapist is trained to know when to stop, take a breath and continue on if ready.  Just make sure you get a therapist who has done it for a while, there are some that just take a course as its the latest \"thing\" to say you know.   You do want someone who understands trauma. Just my two cents...good luck!"

      "Hey everyone I was just curious about any responses I might get on a psych forum, my 1st post, from posting some of my struggles. I basically had childhood trauma and neglect (divorce, alcohol, drugs, narcissism), and I wasn't really aware of how all the pieces made sense about how I got to where I am at, until I started to try to figure it out, with limited success.  I am also realizing the need for support, but a bit unsure about that. I struggled with social anxiety in school growing up, pretty severe insecurity with ego to protect myself, and I did not have parents who were very there for me emotionally.  Divorce, lack of love and care and parental physical and emotional absence, corruption by neighbor hood kids, being shamed and humiliated, never-good-enough, lots of judgement and in hypocrisy, no where to turn to get support.  These are some of the themes at various times, but not consistently all of them, all the time. I can't say my parents are actually bad people, but damage was done and I am trying to figure out the broken pieces.  I have read some psychology articles and other types of healing and trauma experts.",
      "I also experienced neglect as child, sexually abused, non-existing parents, anger and addictions.   I have been diagnosed with Complex-PTSD.   Has to do with long term (i.e., years) of trauma vs. one-time incidents (like a car crash). For me, it is constant anxiety, constant scanning for trouble, addictions to help it all, destroying myself and those I love. Here is an analogy I got about CPTSD.  Most kids, when they first get stung by a bee, the learn those little yellow and black bees can hurt you.  With C-PTSD when you were first stung by that bee, you not only learn to fear the little bee, but the flowers it was on, the green grass, the blue sky of that day.  Its overwhelming, everything causes anxiety and fear. Look it up and if financially feasible, look at an EMDR Therapist.   They help put those old traumas to bed and turn the bad to not so bad."

      "I have a preliminary diagnosis based on screening interview and submitted written history of c-PTSD.  Please advise if there is a better sub for this. CSA as a toddler -- no memory of it, but fairly radical observed behaviour change -- much quieter, and extreme modesty.   This was followed by emotional neglect until I left home.  Dad was always a bit remote.  After heart surgery when I was 14 he came home with only a fraction of his mind. Mom had diabetes, depression, and menopause. She had 4 states: Mom, hibernating bear (high blood sugar) angry bear (low blood suger+hormones), and black rock of depression where she would drink coffee and smoke. Read Janina Fisher's book \"Healing the Fractured Selves of Trauma Survivors\"  Read the first 3 pages of the intro, then skim read the cases studies. I found that her description of the self-hatred, emotional numbness, internal warfare, self sabotage spoke to me.  \"This gal gets it.  She's reading my mind.\" She also has a workbook, \"Transforming the living legacy of trauma Fisher's model is fairly standard structured dissassociation.  Under severe stress, we partition off a fragment of our personality, often a limbic brain fragment to handle the problem.  The pre frontal cortex is largely shutdown, so there is reduce to no narrative memory of the event. Therapy consists of reconnecting to these shards, and bringing them into awareness with love and compassion.  Dual awareness is big in keeping from blending or being hijacked by the shard's memories. I do not have flashbacks in the common use of the term. Sometimes a mood, unexplained, or a scent that is clearly impossible, or a vignette that makes no sense to me at all.  (What does it mean to be in a metal shop, and hear someone shout, \"Pink! Don't look!\"  Who is Pink?  Why shouldn't they look?\")  None are frightening. Just odd. I have had a couple of nightmares -- one got me started on this quest -- that kept me awake for hours after. I've been applying my limited understanding and have some success with shards that formed in my teenage years. These I'd already at least partially integrated with.  This has given me much better understanding of who I am, and I like myself a lot better.  (Although I like some of my shards better than I do myself...) Part of the results of the early trauma, seems to be a bunch of pre-verbal shards.  I have had very little success in communicating with them, unlike the case studies in Dr. Fisher's books. The only method I've found that works is to propose responses, and then feel for a resonance.  I worry that I'm just manipulating puppets on a stage when I do this.  So far no coherent picture emerges. One of my biggest symptoms is blunted affect.  I occasionally can feel anger, but it's a cold anger.  Burning rage isn't there.  I can feel sad, but not sorrow or grief.  I can like people, but not love them.  I figured I wasn't wired right, until I discovered the CSA and it's implications. So some part of me decided that to survive, I needed to turn the emotional volume control down.  How to I contact that part, welcome it into my life again, and persuade it that it's ok to release the dampers? I expect that turning it back up is going to be hard. but every thing I've found about \"emotional numbness\" says that I need to address the cause first. So far my only reliable access with these younger parts has been to put myself in a dual awareness state, and try to reach out with a curious compassionate attitude.  This does result in a modest adreraline rush, stronger heart beat (but not signficantly faster) and a large collection of odd muscle twitches, jerks, an spasms reminding me of the Christmas I ate a quarter pound of chocolate covered coffee beans in a single sitting. I'll try this for an hour.  Once I stop trying, it takes another half hour to \"un-twitch\" enough to get to sleep.  Needless to say, this is not a satisfactory way of communicating. I really wish my brain came with an owner's manual. I start with a Fisher trained therapist in March, but I want to get started.  Any tips?",

      "I live a state that swings between confusion and happiness. Though I work as a teacher and live a full adult life, due to my disability (schizophrenia), I stay with my mother, who abused me for years, especially as a teenager and young adult. Let me stress, she is currently one of the most lovely people you could know. She shows me genuine care as well as though around her. When she abused me, she was suffering from alcohol abuse mixed with drugs (prescription). She had a very traumatic past too. I don't know why she chose to abuse me, but I fear she may have caused my schizophrenia. I always thought it was genes at first, but some research revealed to me that trauma can cause it as well. While we never fight or talk of the past, I hear voices and have nightmares and go through deep bouts of sadness that I can't explain to her. I'm also terrified of displeasing people to the point of losing them. I did once confront her, and she ended up having a nervous breakdown. My older sister, who was not abused (and unaware/disbelieving of my experience) wouldn't let us speak as she recovered and didn't forgive me for years. So I never talk about it with my mom for fear of hurting her or my siblings. Of course, I see a doctor and counsellor for my illness and with hesitation have admitted the things that happened to me. They promised not to tell. And I have a father figure who I share just about everything with (he is a great support, and sent me to this forum). I'm not asking for help. I just wonder has anyone else experienced a complete 180 and change of their abuser? When my mom came off drugs/alcohol, and got therapy, she became wonderful! I mean, you would have no idea of our background. She also greatly helped me when I fell apart due to my illness. I've forgiven her to an extent, but don't know if I can heal or forget. I wonder how does one cope internally if they maintain a relationship with a former abuser? Thank you to anyone who listened.",
      "That is extremely difficult. Your story here is not uncommon. In many cases here for many reasons the mother has become abusive and the family dysfunctional. The child is damaged and as such unable to become self sufficient or independent. The child then has no other option than to remain in the same environment that caused the disability that prevents them from leaving. In most of those the mother has not actually changed. Those stories are heart rending as apart from listening not much we can say to help. So yep, not uncommon among abuse cases, also not uncommon for abused children to not be able to successfully partner up, which again brings them back home. So glad you have a counsellor. I hope they can help you navigate these very mixed feelings you must experience about your mom and your home. One thing I have learned here is that we all become alcoholics drug addicts, shopper shopaholics, addicted to gambling, or hoarding. None of us get a, get out of home free card. (If my wife can find an empty space in our house she will fill it - with a bargain, or several of the same bargain if the price is low enough - our grandchildren will be using the cards and Christmas paper she buys each year even though we still has many years worth in stock - but it  makes her happy - for a while). That drinking and drugs sounds like something was very wrong somewhere, very sorry for you that you appear the collateral damage of it. This forum deals with stuff at our very core and many are reluctant to open up. They should not be. Damage comes in all shapes an sizes. Kicking stuff around here can be netter than bottling it up. Also great place to rant. You may have noticed I do it from time to time.",
      "She might have changed her ways do you don't report her, or she might not get as much fun out of abusing adults, or she may have an easier time resisting urges or fewer excuses when sober. Abusers often are nice to everyone else besides their victim, making others think the victim is lying. Abusers also very rarely change their beliefs, but they do change their actions when they learn it is wise to do so. There is a chance she chsnged, but I advise you to not bond with her. Just use her for support until you find better support. Also, abusers always start nice to build a bond so you won't leave. They tear you down after that.  She might be starting that cycle. So don't give her your heart or sympathy."

      "It's been 47 years since my trauma.  I still have debilitating dreams.  I have come to imagine the dreams as knotted up muscles in my brain, and the physical fear as painful gas bubbles buried deep beneath layers and layers of knotted up muscles (dreams).  Once the gas bubbles begin to come through it may become too painful and the knotted up muscles push it back again.  By controlling the dream the gas is released slowly and at a pace I can handle.  But once the gas is released I feel so much better.  The emotion needs to come out to feel better.  Don't fight it, control the fall.  I have read about medications that can decrease the dreams.  That would greatly help in the severity but I question  if getting rid of the nightmares all together is really wise.  Don't we need the release??",
      "Mine occurred over a very long time. The worst of it over 50 years ago. The nightmares gradually reduced in number, last few years maybe only four a year. No where near as bad, now more bad dreams than nightmares> Maybe, have not a real nightmare for a year. The change occurred with me taking control in my dreams and trying to kill my abuser. I never succeed, I now wake in panic when I just can't finish them off. Still much better than before. At least I don't feel that terrible humiliated feeling all over again. I have read as much as I can to understand what happened to me, and how society and everyone around me let it happen. I think that understanding helps. Never a day goes by when at some point I see something, hear something and think of something that happened, or lie in bed wondering how someone could do what she/they did. I am glad you are finding it getting better. Hope you can continue to experience the improvement. Take care."

      "I've been having so many terrible flashbacks (times of abuse) and flashfowards (imagining what will happen in the future). I feel like a little child though I'm really a youngish adult. I have schizophrenia and PTSD, and I keep hearing today, \"you're a bad daughter, you're a bad daughter.\" It hurts so badly. Every little sound comes as a sign against me, every spoken word feels like pain that I caused. My mom used to abuse me, but she's so wonderful now (because she stopped the substances and got help). My dad is dead, but he left so many broken promises (he was brave as the cancer killed him, and tried to keep us safe that way). My papa (honorary father) is very stressed in his own life and has to walk on eggshells with me (he says he'll never leave me, but I'm so scared I'll force him to). I'm a bad daughter, I'm a bad daughter. I want to be good. I try so hard to be good.",

We just have to try to do the best we can, with the hand we're dealt.  Would having an arm broken in an accident through no fault of your own, make you a bad daughter?  No.  Would having cancer, or a cold, make you bad?  No.  Neither does PTSD or Schizophrenia."

      "Sorry if this is a silly question. Is this the best forum/subforum to discuss cPTSD? Especially in the context of complex trauma rather than PTSD itself. If this is not, which one is? to put the question in the bigger perspective, i just discovered that all my mental difficulties that are very difficult to classify (ADHD, BP, BPD, atypical depression, dysthymia, adjustment disorder, PTSD, anger management, anxiety, social phobia, emotional overeating, addictive personality, ASD, etc) can be simply explained by the concept of complex trauma. I suspected that after reading a book by Pete Walker on cPTSD. but after listening to a series of lectures by TIM FLETCHER i realized he describes exactly me and my spouse in our troubled relationship. in case anyone wants to listen to the whole series (a serious time commitment; i listen while commuting): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IxEwPMqB-c",
      "The silence is deafening, LOL. i got my answer, thank you. now need to find myself a better forum to discuss it.",
      "I used to read on this forum for a while back in 2016 and 2018 as a couple of saved drafts tell me. I am diagnosed with C-PTSD alongside Schizoid Personality disorder in 2017. Back in 2016 I was considering C-PTSD diagnosis or Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified type 1b coz of observed secondary dissociative symptoms. I was following insights from The Theory of Structural Dissociation of the Self from Nijenhuis, van der Hart and Steele. Which puts both in the realm of secondary dissociation. For some reason I felt most at home in the DD-NOS board and not this board. I felt this board was dealing too much with concrete trauma related problems where mine seemed more atmospheric and non verbal (dissociated?) for lack of a better word. The dominant dark state I was in that time had a dark blue affective color. May be you should give the DD-NOS board a chance?",
      "Thanks for that, on several levels. Something to follow up. I think cPTSD is a grey area and there is still much to be learned. When I say grey I mean layered. We can have effects we clearly know and others can clearly see and I think other effects that switch on and off and we are barely aware of them as they are so \"normal to us\"",
      "I'm going to check out those lectures later, thx for sharing. That list sounds quite familiar I also think I might have cPTSD and/or a dissociative disorder. I'm still reading into it."

      "so, long story short, my trauma involves beds and being asleep, along with being in a house setting. though im sure other people also struggle with going to bed. the whole sitting in place, waiting to go to sleep thing, only leaves me open to think, and it usually spirals from there into flashbacks and intrusive memories that keep me up all night. i've struggled with this for a long time and i find that listening to music or just waiting until i'm too exhausted to think works. journaling also works but again, i spiral when left alone with my thoughts lolol. this usually screws up my sleeping schedule, though, so i'm curious if anyone else has any tips, or anything else they do to make sleep easier?",
      "No ptsd here, but other reasons to find it difficult to go to sleep. Listening to music, or, in my case more likely, well known audiobooks, works as well, as waiting until i'm too exhausted to think, right. In earlier years, when i was with no job, sleeping during the day hours, worked as well, as I felt… lets say \"safer\" then. And I experimented with my sleep environment es well: Extra hard or soft mattresses, light or extra heavy blankets and which of all the different pillows to choose, showering cold or bathing hot beforehand, etc., etc., etc. Found something, that worked for me (but I assume, that everybody is different here).",
      "Don't consider myself to have PTSD, but yeah, sleep.  Especially if I'm alone. Well for many many years I took Benadryl.  Now I am on Trazodone to help- half to one tablet. So I guess I'm cheating a little- but still, I can find myself sleepless, especially before I got put on the trazodone. 2ost wrote: Listening to music, or, in my case more likely, well known audiobooks, Oh music keeps me up worse. In my case, I'll put a well-worn movie on my phone.  I have a recliner I'll go get in, I'll put a movie I know forwards and backwards on- one that I don't have a large emotional investment in, either.  I'll watch it for maybe 20 minutes at the most, then just set the phone aside and close my eyes and listen to the audio at a low volume.  It's pretty effective for me.

      "Locked doors. I had a very bad incident when I was trying to sleep, not sex abuse but someone trying to break my neck. So for a long time hard. Where I positioned the  bed,  how I slept in the bed helped. Used be be wide awake on hearing a noise and ready to respond. That took maybe 30 years to get better. I now sleep well most nights. If I have had a triggering event during the day, then the door must be locked, (preferable have a large wardrobe pushed against it as well - never done that as my wife would freak out, but have been close). So basically appearing quite paranoid and making sure of my physical self - body security, helped. Other one is exercise. If I had not gone through a phase of intense exercise (for 16 years) I know I would not be where I am today. Gave me a distraction at night and levelled out my hormones which due to PTSD were a mess. Helped me control cortisol."

Never come across anyone with this before and it in many ways it so me. I called it aloof, arrogant, not sure what to call it. Publicly I am withdrawn, hate socializing but when forced into it through work situations family visits (wife's family -as I have detached from my own) I go in determined to mingle enjoy myself, then find myself counting the minutes until I can escape and trying to avoid saying something I will regret. At functions I will detach from my wife who likes socializing (she tends to drop verbal hand grenades though). I used to grab a drink, even go sit in the car and listen to the radio and read. This is my take on it. Apart from my abuse I found school and other environments reacted negatively to me because of my baggage. My clothes, my always poor health, my awkward behavior. I was alienated. I still did ok at school despite it and used this as motivation to show them I was as good if not better. I felt if I could just pass, with the crap I had to deal with while they had nice normal lives, I was indeed better - hmmm come to think of it I still do, but have learned to try and not be abrasive anymore. (that never made my life easier - fired 4 times in seven years - luckily I am good enough to be self employed.) So although what you have is not common - to me it is a very normal reaction to an abnormal environment. The lesson from me though is to try and hide it in the work place in particular (I could not tolerate fools) it can make life hard. Take care."

      "hii, i don't know if this is the right place to tell my story but i wanted to share it somewhere. I have to tell my therapist next tuesday and i'm terrified and i want to hear some opinions or just talk about it with strangers first. It's about sex so it can be triggering for some, sorry <3 As far as i know i was never sexually abused, and i think everything started because i have been lonely all my life or maybe my parents gave me some emotional trauma, but i don't know. When I was in my first year of high school i was very lonely and i ended up on random chat sites. I sort of grew dependent on this as a way of social contact, however eveyone would always leave once they figured out they couldn't get more from me, so after a while i ended up going over my boundaries until there weren't any left. my view on sex and attention was completely broken and i felt like the only way i could be tollerable to people was if i was 'useful' for sex, and that unwanted advances were a form of flattery, like i was so attractive to someone they couldn't behave themselves. sextibng became sort of a way to make me feel okay but was also a form of self harm. I knew what i was doing was wrong, but if i would stop i would be completely alone again. all of this was so damaging to the way i see men, because all my experiences with straight men up intil i was 21 have been confirming this idea that men can only think about sex and will do everything to get it. I mean men online didn't care that i was 12, or 13 or 14 or if it would be illegal or anything. the first straight guy i ever hung out with alone didn't care that i wasn't interested or gay and he pulled up my shirt to see my boobs anyway (he did assure me that i had nothing to be afraid of though, because now he knew for sure he didn't like me and if he wanted to actually rape me he could have easily done so) and the first interaction i had with my roommate at uni was him asking whether i liked it best to get fingered or to get ###$. when I lived alone i started to be more lonely and i also had more freedom to do my thing online. things ended up more intense and extreme and degrading and i was so embarrased i isolated myself. isolation has been a process ever since i started talking to men online when i was 12, but that year it just got worse. I didn't have any friends, just these men that would treat me like $#%^ online. i knew it was wrong, i knew it made me feel bad, but i also knew that i couldn't stop because i didn't want to be alone. i am out now thanks to meeting a guy that was actually nice to me. he listened to me and didn't judge and help me to break everything off. i still feel very lonely and i have a hard time not going back at times. It's like because i'm out i can see more of how ###$ up it was and i can't deal with that weight on my own, so i need to find something to distract me, and that used to be doing messed up $#%^. this morning i realised that my pattern of looking for people to continously treat me like $#%^ started way before i ever went online, but in a non sexual way. It scares me. i remember playing with barbies with my friend in primary school and i always wanted to play someone who was either sort of a slave or just being bullied by someone with more power. i don't know what this means, but i know it has been there for as long as i can remember. anayway, thank you for reading my ramblings and if you have any opinions, advice or recognize some stuff please write me back. I know this is probably very mild compared to eveything else on this forum and i don't know if it counts as anythign traumatic, but i needed to share it somewhere lis",
      "Not much I can say and I truly hate saying this but it sounds like it may start with .. \"tell me about your parents ?\" I think that will be there somewhere even if it is just to rule that out (which it very well may be). Hope your therapist can give you some tool moving forward."

I’ve experienced abuse also, in childhood and then again as an adult in a relationship. PTSD sucks. The freezing up and the heart racing and nightmares are awful. This feels a little different somehow. Like I have just worn right through on the inside somewhere. It’s hard to be hopeful. And giving up isn’t an option, and I feel like I’m past being sad and just angry now at all of life. I almost miss being sad, because then I wished it was different and I guess I felt that it could have and should have been different. Now I just feel gritty. Like there isn’t anything else. Like I don’t want to think about happy things because they just make me angry. I don’t want this to be someone my kids have to live with. I don’t  want to make them this angry. But I feel like just controlling the outward facing part isn’t good enough anymore. The inside part seems to be eating me alive and I’m having trouble caring about things that I really should care about. I find myself saying hurtful things, and being short tempered, when it isn’t anyone’s fault. But yet I don’t really care enough to try harder. I do, but it just feels like it takes all of my energy to keep all the rage from leaking out.",
      "Wow that was like some one reading my past. Quite surreal. Could have written that myself. the whole thing. I will have to think about that and how I got from there to where I am now. I am away and heading home tomorrow. I will come back to you but will be a couple of day. I will PM you when I do.",
      "Reading that was just like someone had taken my life and put it in print. This is what I  now know. PTSD has triggers. The physical and mental. We get to know our physical, those things that create instant anxiety, high stress, and heightened senses, while others around us are unaffected. I have also found mental triggers can be as wearing. They are those things, that turn our thoughts back to the past. How life has been unfair to us, how we have had to struggle while others skate free. Those thoughts left to run their course will lead us angry and or depressed. They are caused by triggers that are all around us. You stand in a  shopping centre and hear a mother abuse a child. You go to a mothers day event where everyone gushes about how wonderful mothers are. An item on the news. Something that jogs a memory about getting fired because of our baggage and no one knew what was happening. All painful memories, that we need to tread around and not get stuck on. Try and realise when this is happening and it sounds corny try and control it. Try and move your thoughts along and not get stuck there in that loop. Wish I had more. Good luck, if you keep trying it gets better.",
      "Thank you so much Terry. What you are saying feels like it makes sense. Thank you so much for sharing that with me. It does help. I hate knowing that someone else has been through this, but I so appreciate that you understand and  took the time to try to help me get through it a little easier than I would alone. I am sorry if I dredged up old bad memories and made you wade through them again. I wouldn’t want to do that to anyone. I will try to keep your advice in mind. It feels like good advice that I’ve probably known before, but tend to forget too often when I’m running around full speed in the darkest corners of my head. Sometimes I don’t recognize the loop, but you are right. Thank you",
      "Yeah easier to say than do. Why I also talk about having interests, whether, news, movies, books, sport, whatever. Things we can mentally go to to take us out of these loops. I once coached my son's baseball team. I used to rotate these young kids in and out of fielding positions, so the all could be infielders at times. Used to wake at night and then rearrange the fielding for three innings while lying in bed. Just something to control where my mind went rather than let it drift to the past. Something people don't understand is that many of us have very little memory of our childhoods. We don't go back there, as the strongest memories are the worst. I find it hard to find a good one, as they are tucked under layers of very bad memories, somewhere now out of sight. Which is why family contact is hard. Mental triggers everywhere."

      "I've been told by my first T that I have all the symptoms of PTSD but \"not the criterion A\" (because I didn't tell all of my trauma, probably shouldn't have hidden it), and my new T said I do have it. I feel like I have to give a disclaimer, sorry, my OCD makes me unsure of whether or not I have an official diagnosis. Anyway, my new T said ERP could help with my post-traumatic stress. I've done it with OCD, but never with my trauma. My T is a trauma specialist so I know she knows what she's doing, but I'm still extremely anxious about the idea. Has anyone had any experiences with ERP? I just want to know what I'm walking into first."

If they don't feel like you, then they might be dissociated identities. People with PTSD can have emotional fragments, but they wouldn't be developed to the point where they would have their own thoughts and opinions. If you experienced ongoing trauma as a young child (neglectful or emotionally unavailable caregivers, etc), then you could have OSDD or DID. It's important to figure out because treatment for PTSD might help some symptoms, but if you have a true dissociative disorder, it needs specialized treatment. You may want to look at the DID forum on here, and/or read up on DID and OSDD to see if anything resonates with you.",

      "I do experience auditory hallucinations. Have since I was a teenager. Had a few visual hallucinations as well, but more often just hearing things that aren't really there. Most often mine are at night, early morning, or at times when I am very stressed. Most commonly I will hear what I think is a radio playing outside my house, or down the hall, or murmurs of a male voice having a distant conversation or argument. Several times I have heard more sharp, louder noises, such as a scream or one of my kids crying, or a dog barking, or a crashing/breaking noise. Then when I would get up and run to check, they are all sound asleep and as I search for the sound, I realize that it must have been a hallucination again. I brought it up with my therapist once, and she said it was probably a sleep disorder. I dunno. A couple of nights ago, my son was singing to himself late at night and I could sort of barely hear him and it really set me off on a loop trying to figure out if it was real or not, lol. He said I sat up in bed across the trailer and yelled something at him that didn't make and sense and so he apologized and stopped.  I felt bad for yelling at him, but also freaking out and confused as heck because all my normal coping methods were not working!",

      "Good day everyone, I wanted to make a post on here because I have been struggling with having any meaningful friendships for 11 years now and it's driving me crazy at this point. It all happened in the seventh grade when I was 13 years old. My mom decided to pull me out of public school and put me into homeschooling. Her unfounded and paranoid concerns were that I'd get into severely bad things if I attended a public school like everyone else, so she thought it best to homeschool me... except, she wasn't the one who was overseeing it. Instead, I was taken to a couple's house where they would tutor me and a lot of other kids. All of us were Muslim, and this is relevant because it explains some cultural things that went on. I went to the school for about a month, thinking everything was going just fine. That's when one of the tutors spoke with my mom and all of the other parents. She told a very big lie about how I had put my hands on one of the boys that was being tutored at their house as well (a big no-no if you are a Muslim girl), and that was something that absolutely never happened. When we got home, my mom then threatened to physically harm me if I caused any problems at that school. I was afraid of this happening, so I did my best to be as good as I could be at the tutor's house, even though I hadn't done anything wrong to begin with. Things only got progressively worse from there and more lies were told. Eventually, I ended up developing a severe phobia of hearing the phone ring, made myself sick to avoid going to the tutors' house, and I ended up losing all of my remaining friends after the additional lies and an incident where I had said that I hated the taste of kebabs. I can still clearly remember riding in their car the next day to go to the tutors' house and hearing my friends say that their mom said they couldn't talk to me or be my friend anymore. I was stuck in that tutors' house for about 5 or 6 months before, finally, people started pulling their kids out of the tutoring because of all the drama. Once I no longer had a ride to their house, I was pulled out too and put into homeschooling where I basically had to teach myself how to do things since my mom didn't want to help very much. It was only after this traumatic 5 to 6 months that my mom finally told me that she knew the teacher had been lying the entire time. Also, my mom told me that my ex-friends had told their mom all of my secrets and that her mom told my mom, so now I felt really betrayed. And, as a side note, those secrets were harmless and innocent, like crushes I used to have on boys in elementary school. Mom didn't like me having crushes, though, and would make me feel afraid to talk about, have crushes on, or even be around boys (even if I was related to them). After that hellish nightmare of an experience, I was never able to make close friends again. I always kept my friends at a distance, and still do to this day. It no longer feels safe enough to trust others with getting to know me or my interests or safe places. You never know when people will turn on you and stab you in the back when you thought you could trust them. Mom said that if you want to keep secrets, don't tell anyone about them, and I think she's right. I can't let anyone know about who I truly am. I'm not a bad person, but I'm complicated, and that's enough to warrant scaring people away or attracting more abusive people into my life. I know this isn't any way to live, but I can't help but be petrified of others getting too close to me. Anytime someone tries to get close to me, I push them away or run away (one time, I literally did run away from someone). I'm 24 years old now and want this all to stop. So now I come to you all asking for help. How can I start to overcome this debilitating fear that has plagued me for the past 11 years? How do I begin to foster friendships that will be close and long-lasting? I don't want to live the rest of my life alone. It's seriously too painful for me to bear any longer.",
      "Oh Wow! I am so sorry that you went through all of that! I also feel like your experience is so eerily similar to mine, that I could have written a white southern baptist version of your same story. I also was homeschooled, I also had a mother very much like yours, I also went to several \"home group school\" type things over the course of my 12 year homeschool experience. I got out easy compared to what my younger siblings suffered from these scenarios. But I do relate very much to your feelings about having trouble trusting or letting people in. I am 37 and I don't really have any friends either. I wound up in an abusive marriage when I was 18 and now have PTSD. I am walking a similar road to yours right now. That feels strange to say, because there aren't that many people out there who understand this road. I've felt very alone for most of my life. Homeschooling was not a very popular thing when I was a kid. Now that everyone is doing it because of Covid, I am feeling like I am suddenly in a parallel universe where some of my secret thoughts are oddly now broadcast in snack commercials and in memes on Facebook from people that I have never had anything in common with. For me, I feel that my beginning lies in learning how to be a friend to myself. I cannot speak for you, because we are each unique, but I hope that you do find peace with yourself from the criticisms and the terror of your experiences. You are the only one out there who is exactly like YOU, and no one else can fill your shoes. For me, today, you have been an amazing encouragement, and I feel less alone because you shared your story. If you and I can find common ground here, then perhaps there is hope that we can find more common ground with each other or with others in the future. Thank you for your bravery!!!!"

I guess the reason for my ramblings is for accountability and to hear others experience with similar feelings and struggles I've been noticing more and more how I get kinda impulsive and radical with buying stuff when I'm on a low... It's usually either craft related of toy related.. Mixed with wanting to give my daughter all the things I never had, aswell as fulfill a child like desire to play and get excited, a project something to focus on and in turn lift my mood... Last month I brought loads more scalextric, now I'm considering buying a lego train track so my daughter and I can motorise her Hogwarts Express train. It is something I considered buying at Christmas along with her hogwarts train. This seemingly monthly occurrence is leading me to believe my periods may be connected. Although I've only just started recording when they actually come. Also just through coincidence it's when my prescription for meds runs out which always means me having a gap of between a few days to a week of no meds as I always forget to get the script in time. So it could be that.. I often feel like my child has to many toys because of this, but not sure if that's jealousy from little me, or thestress and overwhelm that I feel when having to tidy her room. But I do know that I'm still paying off paypal loan that i used to buy some family Christmas presents and my last craft splurge...

We still hold onto so many of their toys, she even started buying for grand children even though neither of of sons are married. And yes, it brought her joy, and considering her life, I can't complain. Just make sure your money is okay, and rather than go for a whole new something, maybe just add small somethings. Like if Lego, a few new Lego characters. or Scaletrix, another new car.. and I am the same, but the stuff has been guys things, and if I was tired or down, yep, so was my judgement. Buyers remorse.

You may want to spend some time reading posts on the DID forum to see if you can relate. Hormonal shifts, fatigue, changes from meds--all of those can lower defenses and make it easier for dissociated parts to come forward and take over, or to exert more passive influence. The somersaulting from one opinion to another and feeling dizzy--those are often symptoms people report when they're switching from one part or alter to another. Just something to consider, because dissociative disorders are so covert and can stay hidden for many, many years in people who are SURE they don't have DID/OSDD (raising my hand here...).",
      "Thank you for you reply.. It's hard isn't, I feel like I'm living through her sometimes which I dont want for her. Sometimes after I realise I've taken over her idea or like run away with it, which cant be good for her self esteem and stuff. I'm going to to see how much money I have in a few weeks basically if I have anything left then I'll buy it, I get buyer remorse with anything I buy anyways doesnt matter if it's like necessity or not.. Also considering a private child psychologist to negate any crapiness i've projected, she does have adhd and asd traits so could be a good call.. Thank you Terry e it feels good to know I'm not alone when it comes to parenting issues when a survivor. Gangs all here. Dissociation is something I believe I experience a bit of as a part of CPTSD.. I wouldn't describe myself as fragmented or an us, I feel I have some parts of me that have emotions that dont feel like they come from me, occasionally in high stress environments I feel like I'm looking at the world through a circus mirror or fish bowl.. Last year after a very hard therapy season I locked myself in a toilet didnt feel able to come out  had a pain attack considered crawling through ventilation system like some bloody die hard film, then overdosed on my PRN anxiety meds.. Just kept popping them in thinking at some point it'd help, but at the same time thinking  wtf man I'm crazy but not being in control to stop it.. I feel I'm on the scale somewhere of DIDNOS, but as even DID is not really properly recognised in uk where I live there not much chance in getting clarification on it. As I understand DID/DIDNOS is formed when a child under about 7 is in a situation where they feel there life is in danger or are experiencing unimaginable pain. Also I remember alot of bits from my childhood with a few blanks to specific things, but nothing truly horrific. *Trigger warning * . . . . . . . . I was groomed from age of about 4-15 with other random seperate sexual abuse encounters until about 17 but never forcibly actually hurt, iykwim.. I my mum and dad both have learning difficulties... My older brother says he remembers being 2 years old because I was just born, and he was crouched in the corner crying and terrified and mum was hanging over him screaming.. I've seen similar when my younger siblings were the same age, although I was older enough to step in... I don't know I question wether that would be enough to cause DID/DIDNOS. They where both a neglectful and mum is really a child herself emotionally with with an awful temper. But they have always tried their best, they showed us love and care when they could. They were just well out of the depth with no support.. Would that upbringing be enough to cause DID/NOS I will have look more though, maybe post my questions in the DID forum?",
      "Was just looking though the DID forum... Found a post from my user that I completely forgot about... Ive been around on psychforum for many many years.

I knew I'd previously posted with Hmm account but forgot I'd posted in DID already. reading those older posts has now got me flip flapping all over, I've gotgo find something to distract anything... Or I should not and stick with this rather than going round and round forever in circles, and never coming to a point of healing again.. -- Mon Jun 01, 2020 5:47 pm -- Sorry I've fudged my head..

      "I used to think it had to be something objectively recognizable as severe abuse that went on for a long time, but it's anything that was overwhelmingly traumatic from the point of view of a young child. The job of the primary caregiver is to help regulate the feelings of their young child and show them how to regulate themselves as they get older. When kids are very young, they can get easily overwhelmed, and if that happens often and for long periods of time (for example with ongoing emotional abuse or neglect), then the natural course of developing a unified identity is interrupted, resulting in OSDD/DID. Disorganized attachment is a big predisposing factor, and that happens when the caregiver is loving and attentive sometimes, and emotionally abusive or scary and unpredictable at other times. And emotional neglect can lead to other kinds of abuse because no one is really paying attention to how the child is feeling. That definitely sounds like \"enough,\" and it's common for people to feel like their trauma wasn't enough. There are people on the DID forum who are in the UK and they have a lot of information about how to get diagnosed and treated. I know that the Pottersgate Center can diagnose it, and that there are good private DID therapists.",
      "Three things. You wonder whether you can consider yourself abused as you believe others may have been abused worse. It is sort of like getting wet. A small shower can get you wet or almost drowning will get you wet. No one will say that complete drowning is not the worst experience,  .... but both people are wet. As to how well we can appear in society will then depend on what happens next/later. Some of us are very lucky and they will find a person or person who will go out of their way to give them, what at that time they need. In my case, I was at 16, and he was regarded as highly eccentric, and not well adjusted, ..but he was an amazing man and just ahead of his time. I was lucky.  Most of us are not. These people are often referred as part of our \"resilience\", when you look at an ACES score. (check out ACES score) Now I know in my case if things had not been so strange ( he could tell something in my family was wrong even if he did not know what) I doubt I would have responded to his advice the way I did. So maybe, just maybe, if it \"had not been so bad\" , I would not have come out of it as well. Secondly- we never come out without issues. Alcoholic Drug Addict Gambling Hoarding Shopaholic (this one is often with hoarding) could you be a \"shopaholic\" .. does it kick in when times are low. Third and final. Don't worry too much about your daughter. If you love her as you appear to do, (seem more worried about her happiness than yours). I think she will be fine. We had two boys brought up with a father with CPTSD (explosive anger at times) and a wife who is anxiety disruptive.. So anxious she throws hand grenades in social gatherings or meetings. She actually has a list of local coffee shops she has to avoid for 6-12 mths due to her actions.   She figures in 12mths the casual staff have moved on and people will have forgotten her face. Despite that two great boys, 39 + 36 one who despite severe medical issues has been successful and the other looks like he has met a great girl and found a very good job (not great money, but doing great work) So just love her and she will know it."

      "My memory is all over the place and I see parts of it as if it were a movie. In this movie its dark and I see a child. She's got no face. She wears dark clothes and a dark hood.. This child is me but she also feels really separate. She's actually in hell and she's all alone. I'm gonna rescue her. I'm gonna go to where she is, take her by the hand and pull her out of hell. Does this sound like cptsd? I've been reading a book on recovery and it seems to fit.",
      "Could be. CPTSD coming from childhood abuse trauma will express itself differently depending on countless factors. I see similarities at some levels with friends I know, but these are general similarities. As an example using colours as a guide, I can see others are also \" blue\" , but we are never actually the same shade, never as bright or as pale. I can definitely see what you describe. Can I ask with these memories .. \"make you feel\" . Do they come on you during periods of \"dark\" reflection? Is there some feeling that triggers these memories ? Do you get them lying half awake at night ? CPTSD though has so many other traits. Go through those and see how many you think you match. especially hyper vigilance, nightmares, lack of trust, possibly lack of empathy",
      "I'm extremely hyper vigilant. Have nightmares and I do lack empathy but I try to have empathy though. I see her when I'm reminded to think about my past. I know it's me that I'm remembering but it's like a different person and it is really dark. My nightmare is pitch dark as well. I'm actually getting anxiety to think about it.",
      "Well you tick a lot of boxes. If I was you I would go forward thinking it is a very strong possibility and do some research on it. When I finally found out that was what it was, it lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. I stopped trying to be like everyone else and kicking myself when I failed. I realised I was as good as I could be considering what I had been through. Learned to respect myself. Did not make hyper vigilance go away but on the occasions (much less) I felt it happening, I just withdrew a bit realised it would pass, limited social interaction. By doing that I was then not having to deal with the consequences of my \"abnormal \" behaviour. Take care.",
      "Than you Terry. The good thing about this is that it's something that I can work with in order to improve my situation. I didn't realise that I'm hypervigilant until 2 weeks ago. But since then I've started relaxing more because I understand that that was related to past events and when I'm in a 'safe' environment I don't need to be on my guard all the time. It's just given me hope really. I've been diagnosed with so many things in my life and if this is what it really is then at least I kno I can get better. Or at least make improvements.",
      "C-ptsd is my new “working diagnosis” it can take a lot of different forms like Terry said, It sounds like a high possibility this is what you could be dealing with.  I don’t have the imagery like you are talking about or nightmares,  but I’m positive I have repressed memories and gaps.  Another way it can manifest is avoidance of things that remind you of certain traumatic events.  I didn’t even realize that I did this but they can sort of connect the dots in therapy.  This diagnosis gets mixed up with BPD a lot from what I understand.  A few ways they tell the difference is if there is self harm and fear of abandonment it’s usually BPD, or if the behavior is motivated by a lack of identity rather than external triggers it could be BPD.",

      "Hi, I have been through some rough things. I've tried several times to find a good therapist. The last 2 that I went to resulted in .... well. I am not really sure how to say it. I left feeling very angry and betrayed. It wasn't helpful. I have read several good books and I've considered online therapy, but I am very hesitant about that. I feel like I need a human being to work through some things with, so that I can figure out how to sort it all out and move forward and get unstuck from the loop I seem to be in. But finding someone who is trustworthy is an overwhelming and terrifying prospect for me. Do any of you have an suggestions on how I might go about beginning this process without totally losing my grip? Any alternatives perhaps to help deal with issues if I can't bring myself to get out there and find a person?",

      "You know you have PTSD when.. When you can feel someone staring at you-  you turn instantly,  and they quickly look away.. seeming startled that you zeroed in on them like that. When you jump and react so much when someone startles you, that you end up apologising to them for making them jump in return. When you hate anyone standing behind you where you can't see them..   you end up turning your body slightly to the side in queues so that you can see everyone.. even if it's just out of the corner of your eye. When there's no way on earth that you'll sit in the middle of a restaurant..   you'll always choose a table where you can have your back against a wall,  or at least to one side of you..    and if you do have to sit in the middle for some reason,   you'll end up acting spacy and distant - and be a crappy dinner companion, because you're on such high alert to everything else. When you can completely calmly handle a crisis..   but going to the supermarket makes you want to curl up and sleep for the rest of the day.",
      "I almost laughed. Thank you.",
      "One of the huge things I think with Child abuse PTSD, is we often do not realise that we have issues. Sure we don't fit with society, so the easy out is too withdraw. That is almost guaranteed through the modern school system, but we withdraw even more, as develop survival skills. Since coming here I have researched my little heart out and have found some extraordinary research papers by some very hard working, caring professionals (some from way back in the early 1970s when it was called child battery). But I may have learned more about myself and who I am, and even a glimpse of who I could have been by interacting here. Yep, Sea all of that and - when you hate going to weddings, parties, end of year work functions (even though the booze is free) that you realise you are not really careful, but you simply don't trust anyone, or that when you say I don't need anyone - well you actually don't need anyone.. that in life you observe, but do not actually interact that you are not just cynical, but expert and look for everything to go wrong, - at least we never get surprised",

To add to the hating going to weddings etc.. When free alcohol can't entice you, because you can't get drunk unless you're comfy with everyone anyway,.   all drinking does is make you slightly paranoid that you sound weird. When people tell you that you overthink -  and you silently say that there's no such thing as overthinking -  you've just thought through everything and they haven't. This is more a ''you know you have ptsd and aspergers''   than just a ptsd one i think..  but; When you know you're acting weird because you see every little reaction and emotion flitting through the eyes of the other person,  but you can't manage to act normal enough at that point. Hugs to you too QG and thank=you for mine.. Another distrustful one over here -   but as i'm getting older and understanding more and more,  I'm starting to trust my instincts about people a little more.

Elephant in the room ... not that I think 99% of psychologists and counselors don't know enough BUT when you cannot sleep because your son is making slight noises in the kitchen. You know it is him .. but every time you hear a noise, you have to say .. \"it is only my son\" when there is a fight at a party three doors up the street and at 1.00am a young guy bangs on your door telling you to ring the police because his friends are being attacked and all you do is grab your Javelin (leaving the baseball bat behind) tell your wife to put the German Shepherd  on the leash while you throw on some track pants (see why I could not carry the bat) before striding into the unknown maelstrom, realising you are not scared, but hoping no one is going to die.. amazing how fast things improve when I turned up.. all became quiet and each side walked away quietly that ability to wake and act immediately not driven by any cortisol response..(after I came back to bed I was soon asleep ... don't think my wife slept for another hour) if there is one thing and only one thing that is a positive from that childhood is that I have basically no cortisol response ... high price to pay for it though we could have this discussion with a 100 professional counselors and psychologists and we would have to continually stop and explain \"yes, it is not just me ...\"",
      "Yep.. all of those. Everyone that knows me is convinced I don't sleep because i'm awake and alert at the slightest noise. I could sleep through a hurricane (and have),  but the tiniest sound indoors and i'm instantly alert. if there is one thing and only one thing that is a positive from that childhood is that I have basically no cortisol response ... high price to pay for it though I don't know what my cortisol response is like actually..  I jump really easily (when someone actually manages to startle me..  usually i've heard them long before they get anywhere close though)..   but in an emergency situation i don't get the rush of adrenaline..    I just do what needs doing, and then slightly puzzle later over why i was so calm (you know the story re the guns and baseball bats already).. My daughter was choking once in the garden on a chocolate bar that my mother gave her.  The neighbour next door saw and was panicking,  and there's me,  ran over to her - somehow performed a perfect ''stop small child from choking'' manoeuvre  (just instinct on that, didn't realise until a couple of years later that i did the exact thing that they teach in baby/small child first aid), and then gave her a hug..   no panicking - simply a calm,  ''i've got this''   action. The neighbour asked me why i hadn't panicked -  i just said that it didn't occur to me - my only focus was to get the food dislodged from her windpipe.  Simply acted without fear or conscious thought. That's probably a little ptsd/weird i guess.. When you have zero fear of walking through the forest at 2am on your own,  but a neighbour inviting you over for a cup of tea scares the crap out of you.",
      "Exactly. Yep I can get s quick startle response. I snap alert, but not aroused. A saw a doc on PTSD for emergency workers etc and one of the things was that afterwards people cannot process accurately what happens. They may think they do, but they are joining together a few facts by making up what they think happened in the middle. After my assault with the baseball bat, I very accurately described the attacker and IDed him. Of the 14 people there and of who only one other was hit, only 4 had credible witness statements and only one other made an ID. I behaved quite contrary to the norm. Of all the stuff in this, it is the one that fascinates me the most. why I am fascinated with the story of Audi Murphy. Congrats on turning RED.",

      "There's so much I don't eve know where to start. Molested 3 times by different men before I was 10, childhood physical and mental abuse from father, raped at gunpoint at 17, domestic violence filled engagement at 19-21, met a wonderful man at 22 and got married at 23. His mother was absolutely horrible to me. First 7 years of our marriage was awful. We are finally in a good place together since her passing. My PTSD was at an all time low in 2012. I was suicidal, depressed, angry, and miserable. (2012 was near the tail end of my MIL life so I had it coming from me in both sides) I ended up going to a psych center for one night - I was convinced by a friend in law enforcement that it would help and it was what I needed - it did nothing but scare me. I was trapped, I was locked up, I was not helped. I was able to get out the next day but I was different. I would get sick just looking at the building when I drove by and I couldn't stand seeing or hearing anything about my \"friend\". I really think he stuck me there for show. To say, \"oh, I got that poor girl help.\" Whatever. He's a piece of garbage. Anyways, I've been doing good for the last several years. Like, not thinking about things, minimal flashbacks and nightmares, I was even sleeping better. But, things have went back to how they used to be. Lots of flashbacks and nightmares, a lot of anger and guilt, sadness, depression, anxiety, crying, and just an all around down feeling. I was watching a TV show yesterday and when this girl reported her rape to the police, they didn't believe her either. (I reported my rape after 2 days, yes I screwed up big, and long story short, they didn't believe me) That's where my anger really comes from, not being believed. Makes me so mad. So messed up. They had a rape kit, my clothes, perfect descriptions of them and their vehicle, where they lives, the guns..everything. I guess since I wasn't all bruised everywhere then it didn't happen. I can't help he wasn't rough and violent, just held a gun to me. I just don't understand. Maybe some day I can tell my stories. I hope so. But I don't know.",
      "Hi Foggy1, Welcome to psych forums. It’s 2 million percent logical you are angry. I’m angry for you. Keep telling your story. Shout it from the rooftops. Don’t let anyone silence you. If someone does try to silence you, take a good look at that person. Then keep telling your story. The anger management board here on psych forums has helped me. In addition to the 2 million things I already do to be ok. It’s different for everyone since we’re all unique snowflakes. I’ve also downloaded a free app called AIMS for anger management, but I haven’t used it yet. It was developed for veterans with ptsd. In addition, I’ve found support groups helpful. Good luck."

      "It is 15 years since my Diagnosis. I may have posted here about this issue, but can not find anything of mine on the subject. What follows is my own opinion only, and could be seen as a progress report perhaps? When I was first seen, I had started reacting strongly to very harsh childhood abuse. I was in my mid 30s when it began to be clear that there were emotional things going on that I could not control. The Psychological community of the 1980s didn't know what PTSD was, and did not know how to treat it. Today, I think they have learned much more, and my outcome would likely have been different if they had known more. In the 50s and 60s, if a child reacted to abuse by a parent, it was almost impossible to get help. Lots of us died, and some of us worse yet, went on to live very troubled lives, and blamed themselves for all the pain. I do not understand why or how it all happened, but as an adult, I avoided most of the painful things that my brothers and mother suffered. I became religiously devout but did not know that it would not solve all my problems. Starting in the early 2000s, there was a very serious breakdown, and the folk treating me felt I had Gender Identity Dysphoria. Now, in nearly 2020, it is clear that my wanting to be the other gender was driven by my hatred of everyone who was my gender, male. They said I had the worst case of PTSD they had ever seen and this was at a VA hospital. In my opinion, the TG designation and subsequent surgeries and hormones in most cases, is not appropriate at all. I probably can not stamp out the TG phenomenon but my intention is to see that there can be an alternative. I got off all the Psych. Meds. in 2008, but remain addicted to Trazodone. I'm at 75 mg a day to sleep, and am trying to slowly titrate off of it. I was down to less than 50 but developed severe nightmares, so went back up to 100 mg. The future is uncertain on this issue.",
      "I'm 65 and my long term extreme abuse has resulted in child abuse Cushings. Bloated face reddish complexion (bright red at times) and \"narrowing of extremities\" - on the arms the phrase is tuliping. The only reason I have put that is so you can see I am empathetic. We all react in different ways. I was unbelievably lucky to have had someone help me at 17. You appear to have gone on much longer than most before it caught up with you. It appears to usually be late 30s to late 40s and I am guessing has something to do with parenting. Had your marriage ended when you were diagnosed? Can you point out any one thing that stopped you coping as you were before. In my case it was my mother finally being put in a padded cell and being told she was quite mad. As a child I missed between 80-100 days of school each year for three years. Had police called many times by neighbors. My brother had an unbelievable recurrence of a very rare ear infection (4 times - odds in billions) and yet she was allowed free reign. You are right. In our day children had accidents. They disappeared. People moved town and along the way forgot which town their child ran away in. A wonderful era of white picket fences and innocence for many, but horrific for a few. I really don't know what they can do for us. I have avoided therapy as it  produced huge anger issues that becomes it's own problem. That was 20 years ago. It was too painful and I have self diagnosed since. With normal PTSD there is a benchmark. The saying \"he has changed..he used to be ..\". We have no benchmark. I look at my childhood photos and wonder what I was really supposed to look like. I am quite different. I wonder what I could have done if not missing all that school. I really should be happy as my life has turned out not too bad, when seen from the outside. Funny thing is that is what so many people have said about me through me life. \"not a very happy person\". Never unhappy, just not happy. I am just rambling now. So very unusual to find someone though who can understand.",

      "Story made short.. Had a weird childhood and I got kidnapped and drugged a couple of times in my teens. Never really thought about it too much at the time. Just kind of bounced back and carried on with my life. Anyway years later I started to become really anxious around people and if a stranger approached me in the street I would get the memory of being kidnapped and I would either lash out or just run. I've never had therapy for this because it's not something I've really spoke about out loud. Wondering if it's worth mentioning the possibility of PTSD to my psychiatrist when I go for my annual visit.",
      "I would say definitely yes, if you are experiencing anxiety in the present related to fears created in a past event, that is potentially related to PTSD.  But even if it wasn't, your psychiatrist still should be able to help with the anxiety.  So you have nothing to lose by discussing it.  I'm sure your psychiatrist would want you to ask about it.",
      "Thank you. I will mention it to him. Sometimes you live with something for so long that it just becomes part of you. Like I've struggled with my anger for quite a while and I think my anger is linked to this as well but I've never seeked help for it. I think the anger does come from the anxiety."

      "No idea if this is the right forum to post in, but since things shifted after I experienced a traumatic event then I guess it might be the most appropriate.  I'm not sure anything is real.  I can't connect with anything... my feelings, other people, my surroundings.  It feels less solid than a dream; things look bizarre and fuzzy most of the time.  In fact when I dream it's far more vivid and realistic than when I'm apparently awake.  I'm almost entirely convinced I'm not actually awake, and I get a multitude of signs telling me that I'm not in the 'real' world and I need to wake up.  Like I'm being held against my will in some sort of sedated state, or an induced coma.  Or a state of catatonia I receded into in order to escape.  I know this sounds ridiculous and I'm capable of rationalising these thoughts as potentially delusional, but nothing looks or sounds or feels real... and I realise the folly of posting this at all if in fact the whole thing is a mental construction as everything in it including this forum would be in my mind.  I used to be sharp and witty and coherent and now I struggle to string sentences together.  As an artist I used to be inspired and full of life and in touch with this profound creativity that flowed from me effortlessly and now I'm in this insipid mire and everything is without colour. A few years ago I was gang raped at an outdoor rave by three men and a woman.  For reference I'm male.  I was 19 at the time.  I'd taken speed and was a bit overwhelmed by my emotions and the woman suggested I go on a walk with her which led us away from the bulk of the crowd.  After it happened I went and sat in a tent and swinging in and out of a panic attack except I was panicking about having done something wrong, getting really upset for some reason about how I'd done something wrong and I couldn't figure out what I'd done, and whenever I went quiet I could hear people talking about me and taking the piss out of me and saying they should have shoved me off one of the cliffs, so I was convinced they were going to do something to hurt me.  I've never felt so confused and embarrassed and scared. Following that night I couldn't think about anything else for months.  Not out of choice, it just kept repeating in my mind, over and over and I'd get intensely frustrated and upset.  Everyone from that scene actively shunned me.  They were a toxic group of drug users with a strange hierarchy that functioned in a clique, and in some ways I guess it's a blessing that it happened, because it forced me to extract myself from unhealthy people whose lives revolved around using drugs, but I was suffocated for years by this guilt and feeling like I'd somehow prompted the attack.  I didn't fight back when it happened.  I didn't know what to do.  I felt like I should have noticed warnings signs and removed myself from that scene before it happened.  The woman once said to me 'if you were older we'd have f*cked you.'  We being her and her husband.  They were maybe 15/20 years older than me.  All four of them were supposed to be my friends.  I spent time at their houses.  Why at the rave? And then it's faded into this absence.  I'm not really here.  I once walked down the canal path and on the floor was spray painted 'wake up'.  A few days later it wasn't there.  I hear voices at night and experience sleep paralysis and then enter dreams that are so lifelike and vivid and colossal I can't believe that those are meant to be the dream and this strange blank fuzzy non-life is the waking world.  I can't feel or care about anything to the point I wonder if it's possible to develop a kind of psuedo sociopathy.  I imagine people will suggest therapy.  I've been in therapy.  CBT.  DBT.  Dissociative coping strategies.  Well, that doesn't turn the colour back on.  I just want to wake up.",
      "Hi I'm really sorry to hear that happened to you. That was so wrong of them to do that. I don't think your reaction sounds too unusual to be honest. It sounds like the circumstances of your rape have triggered the reaction in you a lot. It is normal to feel guilt and anxiety that something you did \"caused\" what happened. They were responsible for their behaviour, not you. But unfortunately our minds will search for reasons, trying to make sense of what happened, when it's actually impossible to make sense of what happened because you can't know the mind of someone who was prepared to make decisions to abuse you- that just doesn't make sense and isn't right of them. It sounds a lot like you are really struggling with the dissociative aspect of your symptoms. It sounds fairly overwhelming in that flat, colourless kind of way. Personally, as someone with severe dissociation, I have found psychoanalysis more helpful than past therapies I've done. Psychotherapy was also helpful to me but I found CBT was a complete waste of time because I felt so disconnected from my thoughts. I get that you just want to be magically able to wake up from the problem but I also think that you seem realistic enough to know that wishes don't magically come true. Perhaps instead put your effort into thinking what you can personally do differently to approach your problem or into thinking why you don't want to approach your problem differently (if you don't wish to do something different that might lead to the resolution of your trauma)..."

      "hello, i have been on this site 3 years ago but i lost my password so i made a new account, because i am having too much on my mind and i really can use your help again. i live in a theocratic country, somewhere in one of the gulf countries, the way my parents raised me caused me a lot of stress in my life i was not allowed to have male friends (i mean in a non sexual way) i mean everything here is separate based on gender, my father was extremely strict and there were numerous times when he abused me physically to make me disciplined, even over silly minor things his first choice was always physical discipline, he feels no guilt or shame for what he did, he believes that he owns me as much as he owns his car or his house, i had no true value as a human being and he was very clear with me on this fact, maybe he loved me in his own sick twisted messed up violent way, but i don't think his good intentions (if existent) count since he used it as an excuse to cause me a Cptsd. i was not allowed to have normal life, i have spent most of my childhood, teenage-hood and early adulthood indoors, i wasn't allowed to leave the house except for school/collage, and i was lucky that my father allowed me to go to a collage, in my country the father/male guardian is to decide if a female of his family can work/study/get a surgery, i wasn't very happy, my dad choose the collage i went to, and i had absolutely nothing to say about it, no matter how good i was in high school, i couldn't decide my own way in life, years have passed and i got my degree few months ago, i am 25 years old now, and i have been thinking that i have the most important decades of life, i have spent my youth and the supposedly best years of my life being mistreated, abused, denied of any human rights, so i have been wondering if i have put the time and effort into getting out of this country into a better one, and if i worked out my way through my depression and my cptsd, is there anything in life left for me ? i wasn't supposed to be born in this terrible place, it's just not fair all the things that i have to deal with and work on just because i was born to a Muslim family here leaving this country will take a lot of hard work, and working on my mental issues all alone because i can't even get help the proper way, make me wonder if it worth it after being locked up here for 25 good years of my life, most of the times i can't find the motivation to make me go through the day. i know this might sound like a silly cause of cptsd, but i can't find another explanation for my depression so far i have been allowed to live but my life choices have been made by someone else most of the time, and i totally hate it, i don't have social skills at all, i don't wanna be around people, and even if i wanted to i don't know how, i believe that my mental state got me involved with the wrong people so i have shut down my walls until everything is ok on the inside to avoid more damage and more bad memories. what worries me the most is starting a whole new life in another country all alone, i have always been alone growing up, but i wonder if i am ever gonna find a man that will actually love me the way my parents never did totally confused and lost at the moment.",
      "It sounds like you've been through a lot of emotional abuse and manipulation and more. I'm really sorry to hear that. On the positive side, you are only 25. There is absolutely nothing stopping you from turning your life around to the positive. For all you know, you might live until you are 85 or something, so it's not as if you are short on time. And you sound very motivated to turn things around for yourself. I don't know anything much about any of the gulf countries, and I think that only you can decide if you actually need to change countries to achieve the life you desire. Perhaps you might know of some people that didn't leave your country and managed still to get a life like the positive one you imagine for yourself? Regardless, any step you take towards a more positive life for yourself will be positive. You may lose some things that you currently are used to, but from that, there will be more space for you to fill your life with people, things and love that you are currently missing."

      "I’m hoping for some perspective from people that may have gone through therapy if that’s ok. A couple of weeks ago my therapist said ‘he’d been getting some of my intrusive images’. We did some exposure therapy regarding a certain situation I don’t want to go into for fear of triggering anyone. I feel like I’ve affected him and now i can’t imagine talking about other difficult experiences. I don’t know if this is something I can get past or whether I should just end the sessions now.",
      "I feel like I’ve affected him I don’t know if this is something I can get past or whether I should just end the sessions now. What is it that you are concerned with? Are you worried that in talking to him you will harm your therapist? Do you feel like if your therapist is impacted by something you say that he isn't strong enough to hear other things you may have to share? Or is it a different reason?",
      "I’m not quite sure to be honest. I feel confused about why he would tell me that. Isn’t he trained not to get affected by this and that’s why I’m paying him and not chatting it through with my friends? Isn’t his 6+ years of training and 15+ years of experience there so he doesn’t jump down the hole with me, he stands at the top and helps me out of it? Hasn’t he heard this all before? Is it creepy? If I tell him more does it mean he will get more intrusive thoughts, therefore I’d be being callous and passing some of my problems onto him? Has he/I made this about him?",
      "I can see why this is causing you a dilemma. On the one hand you're not responsible for his thoughts. On the other hand how can share things with him when there's a fear of him having more thoughts. Is it creepy? Difficult or near impossible to say because of not knowing the intricacies of how his mind works. Has it been made about him? Ummmm maybe but maybe not. Could be he's sharing this with you to let you know how horrendous what happened was. When suffering trauma it's easy to minimise our own trauma. Sometimes it's only hearing other peoples reactions to that trauma that allows you to realise how bad it was. I sat in a support group years ago and listened and was \"omg these other people had it so bad\" it wasn't until a new member joined and one of the group indicated towards me and said \"tell her what you went through, that was absolutely awful\" but to me it wasn't really and it wasn't until she said that I stepped back and thought \"oh yeah, it was awful what I went through\" So maybe it isn't creepy, maybe it isn't about him, maybe it's aknowledgement of how severe what you actually went through was because someone who listened to you talk about it is now having intrusive thoughts - and there isn't really another way to express that to you than honestly of how it effected him. (Could be, I could be wrong).",

When I was in therapy I remember the therapist telling me I wasn't quite ready to hear what her thoughts were yet. And I said, nahhh it wont be an issue, just go ahead and tell me what it is I totally want to hear. At which point she proceeded to talk a whole lot, and while she was looking at me, and I was looking at her I remember my mind drifting off to other things as if I was too bored to listen to what I really wanted (or at least thought I wanted) to know. Minds can be tricky things sometimes in terms of being clever about protecting us. I don't think you should be pushing yourself if you are not comfortable and that in and of itself is a perfectly good reason to not share until you are ready and no one should be pushing you to do otherwise. That is just my take. Whatever it is you have to share its ok to wait. While I don't know your situation at all and just guessing in the dark here its possible that maybe a lot of what you are saying centers around why you may not feel safe talking about certain stuff. If you feel guilty like you are burdening the other person or may traumatize him don't worry this is what psychologists sign up for. If he feels threatened or has difficulty managing himself he will/should recuse himself and refer you to someone else. You won't damage him, I think he wants you to feel like he is willing to go thru some of this with you. If you are concerned about him best thing is to tell him your thoughts, they will be very helpful to him as your perceptions about things will provide a lot of insights to trained professionals. If you are concerned about yourself that is ok too, there is no shame in that either.",

If you are concerned about yourself that is ok too, there is no shame in that either. This. You need to tell him the thoughts and feelings you had as a response to what he said. Ask him why he said it. Tbh, this is actually the heart of therapy--understanding your reactions in the present to things that your therapist says and does, and how those were shaped by your past experiences. If he's good, he will have had a reason why he said what he said, and that reason will have been that he thought saying that would help you in some way. It happens often in my therapy that the therapist will say something that he intends to be helpful, and it will upset us terribly. The progress we've made is that it takes me less time to figure out why I'm upset, to let him know that I'm upset and why, and for us to work it out. Sometimes we even get through and past something like that during a session, instead of me stewing about it afterwards. Most of the changes in therapy happen because of working things out in the relationship and developing a strong connection with the therapist.",
      "Thank you, this is really helpful. I did let him know my thoughts but it was over email and I don’t think I came across very well. I’m worried it seemed like a dressing down, but I also recognise I shouldn’t be worrying about him, this should be about me.  Sadly, I don’t feel able to go back. I guess we wasn’t a good fit, but it also leaves me wondering what to do next. The thought of starting again is hard and it feels like no one understands dissociation.",
      "I would think generally that if you spoke to a therapist about something related to trauma and they were totally unaffected, that would actually be a bit scary because it would mean they weren't properly capable of empathy. As a society we actually want people to be capable of being disturbed at least a bit when they hear about awful things happening to someone, it means that people are caring and want to act the right way to help and not cause harm to others. It is fairly common to fear that a therapist won't be able to handle hearing your experiences. It is worth using this feeling as an opportunity to actually say to the therapist that you are worried about them and how it will affect them to hear your experiences. I think it is common also to worry that a therapist will terminate the therapy in response to hearing about a person's experiences. You could take some reassurance in that ultimately, if you try to talk through your fears and thoughts about the relationship you have with your therapist with them, that if for some reason you both decide it would be better to see a different therapist, that there will be someone else out there that will be able to do the job for you instead. One thing is for sure though, if you avoid going to see a therapist when you start getting uncomfortable, it won't last long and nothing will get resolved. Working through the discomfort and discussing that discomfort is a strategy that has more longevity. I would personally have quit during every single session I've ever had with any therapist otherwise... It's not a comfortable process."

      "Just yesterday I gave my therapist the textbook version of what happened to me (basic facts, no emotions involved), but she doesn't grasp how much it still affects me and I find it very hard to open up about it. Any advice?",
      "Hmmm why do you suggest she  \"does not grasp how much it effects you\".  I think part of their training/style is to keep them emotionally removed so that they can guide us better. I don't think we will ever know how much any of our stuff effects them.",
      "She doesn't know because I haven't told her and I don't think she has the ability to read minds for people she's spent 2 hours total with.",
      "you need time to build trust. a very good therapist would actually have stopped you from spilling your whole story that early in the relationship. to share a story with the feelings that belong to the story is where we get a chance to feel that there is someone with us in the sharing, someone to support us and someone who gets it. as long as we are numb for our feelings and disconnected from relationships we won't feel understood. but to manage it means we have to get vulnerable and we won't ever get vulnerable with someone we don't know and trust. which means seeing them for a longer period of time. Some therapists pretend that trauma can be healed in 3 sessions but they are wrong.",

      "Hi, I'm new here. Recently I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder possibly PTSD and anxiety disorder. So a lot of stuff to wrap my head around. It's hard to differ the sympthoms form one and the others as they do overlap quite a bit. Plus my life was very traumatic and continues to be difficult, so in my everyday life I deal with many triggers. I've been reading through the posts over last few weeks, trying understand myself and my conditions better. Also trying to make sense out of them and you know, accept, I suppose. My diagnosis is difficult to face for me if I'm being honest and I'm struggling with just taking it in. Especially that I've read so much about misdiagnosis, which can be even easier to happen when someone has so much crap weighting on their back. As I went through the forum I could relate more or less with certain topics, sympthoms and stories. And I'm aware that I can't ask anyone to help me check my diagnosis, but there's one thing I'm courius about. Do people who mainly deal with Ptsd experiance strong mood swings as well ? do you get manic states (apart from anger/ rage ), euphoric, almost \"high\" like? if yes could you share how does it feel for you? Thank you.",
      "pepera wrote: but there's one thing I'm curious about. Do people who mainly deal with Ptsd experience strong mood swings as well ? do you get manic states (apart from anger/ rage ), euphoric, almost \"high\" like? if yes could you share how does it feel for you? Thank you. Yes I have PTSD (and now that the nightmares have stopped and I understand it, I am okay with it - it is just who I am) but prior to learning this and working through it, many people thought I was manic depressive (much better description frankly than bi-polar) as my mother is, so easy diagnosis to make. I will come back with more later. oh and welcome",
      "oh did you? that's very interesting for me! my father was manic depressive and ended up committing suicide, so yea I also think that could have had an impact on my diagnosis. Nonetheless, personally I resonate more with manic depressive sympthoms and stories myself. Maybe if you throw some light of your experiances it will help me understand things better. See, I had s@#$ty life yea, but I never felt truly traumatized by it. Anxious, but angry yes, but never fully traumatized. I went to the theraphy, I changed my lifestyle completely (keeping it healthy and simple) and a lot of triggers went away. If I'm being honest I don't really feel like my past haunts me, not anymore. You know, if I talk about it, it's sad. But it is what it is. I have no issue going back there in my memory, I don't feel angry about it anymore, I don't have flashbacks or nightmares; sometimes I think about it, but usually in relation to something else and not in a triggering way. I don't  avoid people or places that remind me of it either. My anxieties are not that bad anymore, apart from mood swings and energy levels changes that come out of nowhere and sometimes for no reason, I would consider myself mentally healthy. Yet I'm not. So when I go through ptsd sympthoms list, I find it hard to place myself there. But I dunno, maybe there's something to it that I can't see. or maybe I do have both. would really appreciate if you shared your story. How was  your ptsd mimicing bipolar? Thank you.",
      "From abuse you get drug addict, alcoholic, gambling addiction, hoarding, shopping addiction (travel addiction is in this) and workaholic. I was a workaholic. Not the \"I love getting out of bed in the morning so I can go to work\" (two of my clients have actually said that to me) but just driven to be successful. I was self employed, basically as I could not hold down a job, (very bad social skills) but could work 30 hour days. (start at 9.00am one day and finish at 6.00pm the next). In a way it was a form of self abuse. It was born of rage and hatred towards society which I thought had thrown me under the bus as a kid (still feel that way). I wanted to prove them wrong. I am not a high energy individual and usually do better on 8-9 hours sleep (in bed at night), but I could drive myself to almost collapse. That mirrored a manic phase. What happened after mirrored a depressed phase. I would withdraw from people (family) etc as much as possible until I recovered. During this time I would be very negative (even more than usual). People would call this depression (I was still however working long hours doing six day weeks, just not REALLY long hours, say cutting back from 65-70 down to 50. That phase lasted 17 years and finished around same time I had an incident that forced me to address my childhood. I definitely have PTSD though but now know my triggers and that it will pass soon.",
      "thank you for sharing your story. It must be difficult for you and I can see how it could mimic manic depressive that way. I guess neither of these disorders is fun to have. I can relate to what you say. I run away from my house when I was 18 and I was very badly driven by a need to be successful. Now I'm driven by a need to be healthy. I get very obsessive by these things though and can overdo even things that are supposed to be healthy (nothing is in large amounts) . When I was younger I would experiance more sympthoms of ptsd and anxiety; bad social skills was one of them. Fear, anger, nightmares, flashbacks. But I tried theraphy and other forms of self improvement techniques right after I left my home and I have to say a lot of stuff disappeared. A lot of triggers doesn't work anymore. I have no nightmares, no flashback, I can comfortably make a phone call and go to shops, I forgave my family and have a healthy enough relations with them, I'm not angry with the world, I don't think people are bad and I don't have trust issues. But I do have mood swings. And even though I don't  exactly like  it, I'm starting to  accept that I might have bipolar disorder too. I go into  a high energy levels where I loose control and love life. Love it to the point it freaking hurts. It sometimes gets activated for no apparent reason. Sometimes it's stress related (not fun for someone who experianced abuse). Sometimes I stay within my current obsessions and interest areas, just overdoing them to the point I start to hate them but still getting $#%^ loads done. Sometimes I get hooked by completely random things. When I look back it's as if I went crazy, as if I was drunk/high rearranging my whole life, but there's no anger in it, it's extreme happiness and in those moments everything makes perfect sense (sometimes I do get messages from above (God/Universe) to do certain things, and I'm not really a believer on a regular basis). And when i crash, I crash hard. From heaven to hell. Complete depression, hopelessness, pure darkness. All I do is sleep and eat, not able to function. I feel like I'm drained, like all the energy has evaporated. It's horrible and I have very little control over it. It's a dangerous place to be. I isolated myself cos I don't want anyone to see my madness. I don't want people to  associate me with my (hypo)manic self, cos even though she seems like fun to some, it's not me and in my regular moods I can't live up to the image of me she creates(hypomania or low mania can be more fun at least from the outside, manic me is better to kept lock in a room), and I, first of all, don't want to be around people when I'm depressed, second of all I don't want to be a burden to anyone. That leaves me with a small window where I'm relatively normal and I could approach people, but anxieties and bad social skills usually kick in here It is a very lonely life I have. After my last year's episode I lost my job and wasn't able to get one since. I'm just not capable. I can function well enough when I'm at home, and can manage my episodes myself, but any sort of disturbance is just hard to handle at the moment. I feel like I'm falling into pieces. I take one bit of my back, something else shows up in it's place. It's a constant struggle. I'm just tired and overwhelmed. Sorry for all that. I just came out unexpectedly."

      "I looked at the abuse sub forums and was like, where do I post? Because I'm all of the above. Child abuse gave me a childhood of bullying, then I was raped, and that all led me into an abusive relationship. Finally, I was almost tortured to death in jail. Now I have PTSD that is so complex I know I will never escape it. Whenever I meditate I can usually do it for 20-40 minutes. Near the end I think, \"Wow! I didn't think about anything bad yet...\" and that's when it starts. It's amazing, the abuse that hurt me more than anything else, more than the rape, the torture, or the months fearing for my life, was losing my service dog. During my second hospitalization my family took her to the pound. It was just devastating. Three years later and I usually cry every day, especially if I attempt to meditate. It's just getting harder with time. Right now I am at a pivotal moment. My dog is forgetting me. I know she is. She was only three years old, she was my entire world, my everything, but I will only have been a small part of her life. I think of my old brain - the one I had when I had her. If I had that brain I could meditate comfortably. Now whenever I see a funny video with a golden retriever, it's all I can think about. Anytime I see a golden retriever, which is all the time. When I walk where we used to go on walks, it's all I can think about. If I stop doing something and have a mind free of thought - it's immediately what I think about. Everything is a trigger. She was with me 24-7 and I lost her at the worst possible time. Three years later and it's still all I can think about. It's not just about the dog. I went into an abusive relationship after I lost her. I was in psychotic grief and completely cut ties with my family, so incredibly vulnerable to my abuser. He stole over $10,000 from me and the last bit of sanity I had left. After that, I attempted suicide twice and was in and out of hospitals for two years. It's not just about the dog. I lost her, and that made me lose everything else. Three years of my life, 22-25, gone. My prime years. Gone. Perhaps the man I would have met and had kids with  - gone. My potential family is dead. My real family is dead to me. The hardest part is that half my family still hasn't even apologized. The ones that did won't listen to me. I just want them to know that they destroyed my life. My sister once said, \"IT WAS JUST A DUMB DOG, GET OVER IT!\" and she doesn't know what they really did to me. They haven't given me the chance to say. Unless I can tell that to them, I can never have them in my life again. I just want them to know what they did to me. That's all I want and I think I could start to heal. I don't understand why it's so hard for them to confront the horrible mistake they made. My Mom says they just have stressful lives too and don't have the energy to talk about it. Really? You can't just spend a couple hours talking??",
      "I urge you to be very, very kind to yourself.  Noticing the turn to distressing thoughts and observing them as they appear is meditation 2.0. Welcoming the thoughts, and the difficult things that accompany the shift of your consciousness to the memories (and the related thoughts) as perhaps rude, unpleasant guests, yet guests nonetheless that you are able to treat with kindness and compassion.  Watch and see where they go? In this way you are able to care for this pain and return the attention to your meditation object, such as Your Inbreath and your Outbreath and then healing is more possible. Also have you tried EMDR.  Are you able to incorporate any kind of movement practice."

      "Hey guys, I am home from university this summer and am back in the house with my parents (one of the sources of trauma). I managed to figure my ways around to cope and got my own \"safe\"ish place inside my room where I don't constantly feel tense and on edge which helps a lot so I am managing. The thing is, my sister (another source of trauma and still rather abusive) is coming home sometime in August and she is likely going to behave just as she always did the behavior will really just... be extremely stressful and triggering and honestly, I can handle my parents, but I don't know how I'll handle having my parents and my sister home. This is even worse because when my sister comes home I'll loose the one safe place in my house because she will be sharing a room and I'll have to move my desk outside into the living room again where not only will I have to actively deal with her and have no place to feel safe, but I will also have to actively be around my parents which was something I've been able to avoid thanks to my room. I would go to my fiance's house and stay there for two weeks but that would cause my dad to go into a raging fit and cause a lot of drama in the house that would probably be more stress and work than its worth and I just like... I don't know how I am going to survive the two weeks like that. I can barely even imagine it anymore. For other notes, I have DID and C-PTSD. But please if anyone can help I am kind of desperate for advice. -- Sat Jun 29, 2019 8:17 pm -- My psyche feels like its ready to shatter thinking about it. I don't want to accidentally split another alter out of the stress of it..",
      "Maybe you could use your fiancé's place as a safe haven.  Schedule some regular breaks over the two weeks when you go there for awhile to hang out.   You could say that you're giving your sister space and private time with your parents since you will both be home at the same time. Just a thought.",
      "I back up what Avatar has to say and please don't think the following is coming from someone who does not understand but I recently had a discussion with a health professional (non pysch or doctor) about the amount of admitted  anxiety expressed by comic convention people. After much discussion we found that as a whole they:- don't exercise watch a lot of screen time don't go outdoors much don't get much sunshine or fresh air You can't change you family or your room arrangements, so try and eat right, get out of the house when you can, and be active (and have some fun). You will sleep better, have better hormone profiles and get through it better. there are some things we cannot change in our lives and some things we can. Hope it all works out okay"

      "Hello i am a 22 years old boy i have a brother and sister and i am the last born. Here is my story: Last year i had a trauma (im not sure if that what they call a trauma)[/color] it was by losing my big sister's relationship since she abused me verbally (in my 2nd year of college i did a surgery to remove my gallbladder i complete the 2nd year and got diploma then i stop education and decided to stay home and do good nutrition and exercising. But my family was pressing me and keep saying to me to go to college and continue my education or search for a job.... A day my sister said that a man needs to work and needs to be tough and needs to have a strong personality and that i am like a little kid, she also claimed that i don't talk with family and i just sit silent, also she said to my mother in front of me \"if you let him go out with boys when he was a child then he must be talking more now\" , she remembered me of a childhood trauma when my mother didn't let me out) and abandoned me after that .(she is 27yo and married.. i used to love her more than my brother and support her too much before and after her marriage). After this trauma i sensed a big change in my personality like i become rage..scared.insulting..hating everyone and everything...and deep sadness.i was seeing just dark ...I cried way too much and i am still crying sometimes now. I stopped talking to my family and friends, and i didn't out from the house for months.and i lost my relationship with god and i stopped doing my worship and pray (the day i stop praying.. i woke up at night and i was unable to breath i moved fast to the other room and i tried to breath hardly,it was so scary...i also remembered after a month of the trauma my mother came and woke me up and said \"you scared me... i thought you dead because i was breathing shortly . i also stopped exercising and playing video games which was my favorite habit.i lost happiness and the sense of being alive, i was unable to stop thinking, its like if i was living in my head.i was just listening to music all day and thinking of suicide but the fear of god and since killing an innocent soul is forbidden stopped me. also i remembered all my past traumas with feelings like hell or being in war. i remembered all the good and bad of my past with all details. I also understood some events ,and how some close people tricked me when i was a child. I lost alot of energy from the gallbladder hard pain which was for a month before the surgery and energy from surgery then energy from this trauma..and i am breathing hardly. I always remember that trauma when i see men i feel uncontrollable jealousy and sometimes i want to cry. or when i see children or whenever someone is talking about personality or manliness,masculine,femininity.... My sister is talking to me now but i talk to her without a real desire its like if she was dead that day. ---> And to add more things about me i think i had ocd/ocpd in adolescence especially spirituality ocd and swallowing/breathing ocd which tortured me alot, I still have some ocd but i do imaginative rituals to get some relief. Plz i need help and support i need to know what was all that hell and if it was something about shadow and ptsd? i can't say to anyone in real life about all this because i don't want them to judge me or having pity..i just smile to people so Plz i really need your opinions and advises. Sorry for my english. Thank you."

      "Hello everyone, I have always been abused as child verbally and physically. As an adult now i always think about the abuse and i have some flash backs, my parents still blame me for everything i have done, failure etc. My father recently says if you are not happy at home leave or just go throw yourself out the window. Im bipolar and im on medication and they say its my fault too. Im currently unemployed and i cant do anything to change my situation.",
      "Thank you for your help.",
      "Im currently unemployed and i cant do anything to change my situation. To me those two don't have anything to do with each other.  You may be unemployed but you can still do things to change your situation.  For one it seems that listening to your parents might be one of the things you could change.  There are other resources available."

      "My opinion is invalid and nothing I post is good enough for approval, so this will likely be my last attempt. That said PTSD is a thing that comes and goes. I don't get flashbacks unless I'm in an extremely bad, stressful, emotionaly triggering situation. I've identified some of my triggers and Inavoid them as best I can. The promlem is the ones that I can't identify, or spontaneous triggers that just happen. Is there an effective way to deal with those? I get everuthing shirt if hallucinations. The worst thing I normally get is an intense emotional recall while doing something unrelated to the traumatic event. I hate when it happens in public because it ruins everyone's day. Any ideas? That is assuming my question is even worthy of posting. The rest aren't so I doubt this is. It's okay. I'm used to being on my own tonfigure things out. Even the VA hates me. It's my own fault. So whatever. If this one isn't approved I'm not wasting anymore of the mods' time.",
      "Hello, Sorry to hear about what you are going through. I do not know much, but I have read that Emotional Freedom Technique is good for dealing with trauma. It involves tapping on certain parts of the body, and this somehow short circuits the emotions. I would also recommend perhaps looking into Energy Healing. One that I do is called NARP, you can find the basic format on you tube. By a Melanie Tonya Evans. She goes through her meditations on youtube and these are for free. It works on focusing on stored trauma in your body, feeling it for a bit and releasing it and then bringing in feelings of healing and essentially attempting to rewire your brain to believe differently. I think it is valid for PTSD, at least I have seen her use it on survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Also, can you get into nature and spend time with animals. All animals are therapy. Even volunteer to help abused or abandoned animals be rehabilatated. Do you have a support group that you can go to? Consider also alternative healing. Can you do some craft and express how you feel through it, even use it to draw attention to others in your position who feel forgotten. Lastly, I wanted to express my solidarity with you in your feelings of isolation and of being taught that you do not count. It is very wrong that men are not given respect for having emotions and are expected to be emotionless robots. And it is horrible to go through the trauma of war, let alone be left to deal with it with little to no help -as I assume you must get, as this is the case in the country live in. I have never been in your exact experience, but I do know what it is like to suffer and be given no validation for that suffering -but treated as if it does not matter and as if I am therefore expendable. This is a big problem in this world -lack of empathy. The only thing really you can do is to go deeper and get into spirituality. if they world tries to mess with you and tears your world apart, you have to create a new one that is built on different foundations that can't be destroyed. What I mean by this, is develop an eye for seeing past the surface -for instance, see through the lack of care towards you from the government and society (as a soldier who has suffered through war) and see the lack of empathy as weakness on society's part and people in general. It is not your problem. And don't internalize it. See things from this view point, that who a person is is based on how they act -this is what a person can actually control and is who they really are. This way, even if you have scars, it's about how you deal with them and not about the fact that you have them. And it is your society's weakness for judging you, and dismissing you based on these. You definetly count. If others around you fail to honor that, this only proves that they lack strength. Even if you have messed up by becoming angry etc, this is still forgiveable and certainly understandable if you have gone through trauma. Make amends and find better ways to deal with difficult emotions and flashbacks. Be easier on yourself. Perhaps also look into any therapies that can train your brain to get out of the flight or fight mode. All the best. I believe in an afterlife, and I do believe that each of us has a team of spirit guides who are there for us. Pray to yours and ask that they give you signs and help you with what you are going through. My sincere best to you.",
      "What do you usually do to stop a flashback and get grounded again? Any strategies to reduce hyperarousal? It is impossible to avoid all triggers. But it is possible to learn how to get grounded, regulate your body and emotions and return to normal life relatively quickly.",
      "I’m a wife of a veteran with PTSD. I hope you are doing ok and receive the help you are entitled to.",
      "Hey, it seems like I am not the only Vet going through PTSD.  It is pretty miserable.  It feels like it is always raining.  I am tired a lot.  Probably from anxiety and antidepressants.  Unfortunately, they help get me through work. During work I am very PTSD.  I feel kind of worthless.  I feel that everyone thinks that I am abusive and a pest.  In fact my coworkers and customers start something, interrupt me, and then I have to finish the job.  I have about 20 projects going on at one time.  It is ridiculous.  In the meantime, I see others not working at all.  It makes me feel very manipulative and bossy.  I am getting educated so that I can get a better job. I have flashbacks that make me irritable.  I think about the guy/girl whose life I may have been able to save.  Fortunately, I never see my fellow veterans that I was in war with.  That would only bring up bad memories.  Ever since I have been through war my PTSD got really bad.  I go jogging or to the library to get out into the community.  I wonder what it feels like to be mentally healthy.  I would like to know.  I hate having a mental illness.  Thanks for the cool topic.",
      "Forum333 wrote: I am getting educated so that I can get a better job. Personally I always felt as long as tomorrow could be better than today I could find a way to cope. That is what you are doing with the study. Hope it works out for you. Wish you all the best"

      "Hello. I'm a professional poker player. Soon I realized that I'm co-dependent and have symptoms of PTSD also. I can't find the link between my poker loses and the flashbacks. Sometimes when I lose even some unsignificant part of my poker money or even just a single hand, I just feel the sensations building in my body. I feel the stress and cortisol going thru me. After that I feel like I survived fight with a bear. I can't understand how my survining mechanism is related to this. It really stops me from working and progressing.",
      "At some level it brings about a threat response. It is extremely complex, but you know that. I can handle very high level work stress easily, I almost crave it,  but could never gamble. We are all different. Thank you for sharing that and I hope you can find some way to work with it.",
      "Recovering gambling addict here - Before I stopped gambling for good , I was getting really weird vibrations in my head at bedtime as I lay there waiting for sleep to come . No pain , no warning . It just suddenly felt like my brain/skull was violently shivering . Laying a hand on my head detected no physical movement whatsoever . it lasted anywhere from 1 - 2 minutes . Sometimes it stopped if I sat up , sometimes not . Gambling triggers all kinds of neurological responses , like increased levels of dopamine and adrenaline. I'm no doctor but I'm guessing that the near-constant high doses of these two brain chemicals had something to do with what I was experiencing . Within a month of quitting gambling , it all but vanished . Don't know if this helps you in any way but I can tell you this - gambling , even for fun , stresses the mind and body significantly . All the best ,"

      "Hi. I was a very, very sensitive boy, but a lot of bad things happened. I was so sensitive, a little stress would drive me crazy, and for years there were no person I could talk to anything. I was really bullied at school by everyone, teachers, and by parents, by brothers. I felt like I am more empathic, intelligent than others, I could feel other people's emotions and see how they exactly feel, while no one gave a $#%^ about them. And as I remember, when I was 13-14, I was raging and stressing so much I didn't know what to do, didn't even understand whats happening around me, but I knew my emotions driving me crazy. So somehow I stopped feeling them. I really wanted to stop feeling, so after a big focus and mind \"tricks\", mindset changes I did it, and wake up the other day without feelings. This was probably the worst decision in my life. I had only rage in me, only hate that couldn't come out, I forget what happiness and love is. The painful years were like a trauma for me. And know I'm working on myself for a long time to get those back and feel like I'm alive. I used drugs too, with weed I could tap into a little bit what it was to feel like. Can anyone give me any help? I feel like... It's in my throat whats blocking the emotions. Like when I breath I feel like... something there. I can't focus on a thing for a long time, I can't daydream, can't feel really anything, just really hardly. Please help me if you know whats happening. Thank you.",
      "I'm similar to you in my sensitivity and perceptions of other people's feelings. The physical sensation in your throat is an insightful observation. Trauma affects our bodies and not just psychology. I'd refer you to The Body Keeps The Score, and Awakening the Tiger as two books that dive into this subject. You can find a lot of talks about this phenomena on youtube by the author's of those books. There is plenty more to say, but that is where I'm able to relate."

      "And it feels like almost nothing has changed. I hardly remember those days anymore. All of the chaos and abuse piled up so high it's obstructed my view of the past. Dissociative Identity Disorder rules my life, I can't remember anything up until the vague, hazy sort-of memories i have of being 17 and chunks of since every now and then scattered behind my skull. I still have flashbacks. I still have nightmares. I still panic. I still am haunted, just as I was when i suffered the first attack, just as I was as a child surviving my mother's abuse. Now with just more drugs. I feel as if past me, child me, would be disappointed in what he sees. I wonder what He would say, if he knew what his horrible actions did to me. It's whatever, I guess. I abruptly flickered into existence one day, I'm sure the exit is just the same.",
      "If that child could understand they would be proud that you survived. You are bent but not broken. I think the hardest thing for many of us is that we live in a society so unlike our own life. Where mothers are the closest thing to God on this earth, where everyone thinks they know the world, but only see the version we get served on the main stream media. In Australia Rosie Batty was married to a very disturbed man, but somehow she believed her son should still have a relationship with his father. The boy was killed and we made Rosie \"Australian of the Year\" for allowing her to share our grief and pain. How nuts is that. Yeah you have some ways to go, but don't feel like you are not a success. we just measure it differently. I used to joke that I felt like such a failure. With my childhood upbringing I should have been a serial killer or at least an axe murderer. Don't measure yourself against anyone who has not lived your life."

      "I was sexually assaulted about six years ago, and it took me a few years to admit what happened to me. I was diagnosed with PTSD last year. Now, I already had depression and anxiety, so I was emotionally unstable to begin with. I've become incredibly irritable and angry, even over minor things. I'm hyperalert and jumpy, too, to the point where my reactions are way out of proportion. I feel contaminated, like I wasn't supposed to be this way and he made me be like this. I hate how much of my mental space has been overtaken by him, too. He just went on with his life normally while I was left struggling. I also feel guilty because I'll occasionally remember something nice about him and even feel like I miss him a bit. I just want to feel normal for once"

      "Does anybody else feel like they are completely numb inside most of the time and although you may laugh, talk seemingly as normal, inside is still numbness. The only feeling that 'I feel occasionally is Anger, other than when I am triggered by certain circumstances or nightmares",
      "Not abnormal. kind of the normal reaction to dealing with abnormal events. The comment above anger due to the unfairness of it, can be damn hard to shift. I have to be honest there. Not that productive really. About the best thing it did fro me was make me determined that the events would not define my life. That is more of a long term thing, but yeah how you are feeling, lots here in domestic violence and child abuse would agree with you. Sorry you went through that, but it looks like you have realised it is up to you how you come out of it. Good luck with it.. Take care.",
      "Both those things are incredibly common, so much so that they're part of the diagnostic criteria. In addition to anger about what happened, a more diffuse anger, constant irritability, being quick to anger etc. can also be the result of hyperarousal. PTSD comes with a lot of stress and when your stress levels are consistently high and your body is constantly on high-alert, you're more likely to get angry, get angry more quickly or feel anger disproportionate to what is causing it in that present moment. With PTSD, your body spends a lot of energy on taking in as much information as possible and keeping your body ready to keep you safe so that when it perceives a situation as dangerous, you can protect yourself either by fighting back, fleeing or freezing up. Anger can be the result of that protective mechanism (fight). But all of this is also really exhausting to keep up physically, which in turn makes you more irritable as well. I've noticed I'm much less likely to be irritable or get angry on days or in places that I feel well-rested and safe or in environments that I can oversee or that are familiar and predictable. On a good day, I may even be completely fine in an environment that would usually feel unsafe if I'm feeling positive and relaxed otherwise.",

It seems to me this is the real world and what others know is unreal, they are just lucky that they never have seen through the cracks. I think this is how a lot of people who've experienced trauma feel, especially if the trauma was caused by or could have been prevented by other people. I definitely get how you feel and in a sense I think it's true. Trauma is often life altering in that it can really shake up the way you have always viewed the world or people. There are just some things you don't think about unless / until it happens to you and many of those things are so unpleasant that many people like to pretend they don't happen or could never happen to them anyway. And that can make it feel very lonely and isolating: not only are you left with all the new information and emotions from the trauma and its aftermath, it can also feel like you are completely on your own in dealing with it when the thing you're struggling with is something society at large does not want to see or at least cannot fathom.",
      "Anger and numbness, yes I feel both of those.  But it seems to lessen over time.  I sometimes wonder if the numbness is because the \"normal\" world just doesn't have that strong impact on me emotionally as the trauma did.  Doesn't carry that shock value.  Maybe like rocking a canoe on a lake after riding through a hurricane at sea.  Just isn't the same.  At the same time, some of those situations in the \"normal\" world will anger me and make my heart race with utter fear.  I'm beginning to understand the anger is because I feel threatened or trapped with no way out.  Maybe the anger is getting less over time because I'm learning to avoid those particular situations, but they still do occur, and I get blindsided now and then."

      "Hello there I have suffered abuse at intervals throughout my life and have bouts of depression, sometimes very deep. The few years of my life have been devoted to healing from trauma and addiction. My life has yet to fully get started and Im struggling to find my way, causing intense worry and sadness. I'm quite a sensitive person and the role I'm falling into is of a poor victim. It doesn't suit me but something seemingly always happens to kick me out of balance. I feel like I'm easily swayed by other people and judgements/ opinions can hurt me. I've noticed a disconnection with others increase over the last while and when not alone, the people I used to associate with from support groups seem toxic and dysfunctional. Could this be projection or what??? I'm going through a tough time and feel like I'm losing my reason. Any input on the situation would be greatly appreciated.",
      "Perceptivist wrote: I feel like I'm easily swayed by other people and judgements/ opinions can hurt me. We suffer from self esteem issues. Many of us try to please others even when it is a detriment to ourselves. The feeling of volunteering and then immediately regretting it. We find it hard to say no. I know people talk about loving ourselves etc. but seriously we need to learn to be selfish, or at least get some balance. I've noticed a disconnection with others increase over the last while and when not alone, the people I used to associate with from support groups seem toxic and dysfunctional. Hmmm maybe because they have lots of problems - why they are in the support group. Maybe not to support you, but use you to support them. I'm going through a tough time and feel like I'm losing my reason. Any input on the situation would be greatly appreciated. Over the years I coined the phrase \"eat and sleep\". It is all that I thought I had needed to get me through. I am now starting to realize that it was also hope. It is not easy for us, never will be, and we will never have the life others take fro granted, but you can find happiness. Don't let go of hope."

      "So I have these thoughts about things that have happened in my past that play out like a nightmare in my head but I can’t wake up because I’m already awake. Most of the time when I have these thoughts they will make me panic instantly. They are based on what happened, but they’re more exaggerated. So for example when I was younger I would get in the car with a girl who had been doing lots of drugs and was clearly intoxicated 24/7 and one time she crashed and it was nothing major and we just laughed it off but I now I can see it like I’m watching a movie just the whole car wreaked and her and I dead even though we didn’t die and that didn’t actually happen? And these sort of thoughts send me into panic- sobbing, shaking, can’t breathe, sweating.... yeah you get the point Another example is last night when a car boot slammed down and hit my forehead (I feel so lucky to be alive tbh) and 30 minutes later I was having a panic attack with this video playing in my mind in third person of me with my head/neck smashed in between the boot of the car. I have a million different thoughts just like these and I wish I could just leAve the past in the past but my brain won’t let me!!!",

      "Hi, I'm new here and have multiple diagnosis, the primary being BPD (30 years of crazy) and secondary psychopathy/co-morbid ASPD alongside PTSD and the development of agoraphobia and GAD. I guess this post is simply to put my current situation and the events leading up to it in words Plus it's reassuring to know I'm not alone in having to deal with really awful things (misery loves company). Where to start... ok, so my PTSD has been untreated because of a reluctance on my part- I worry that I will be overwhelmed by the experience and dovetail even more. In addition to that my ability to be compliant is badly hindered by my agoraphobia & GAD even when I want to see my psychologist. The whole thing is a frustrating catch 22. To put things in context here's a brief rundown of the events that led and compounded my PTSD; In late 2004 my partner killed himself in our car. I was 3 months pregnant and found him. That caused my initial PTSD. Then my step brother was murdered just after my severe IUGR daughter was born by emergency cesarean. She weighed just 1400gm at full term and spent 2 months in NICU (which was not a good time). Jump to 2015 and my mum died of curable cancer. She was a New Age moron so she wouldn't comply with the proper treatment. I was the only one there the night she died and I have complete loss of memory from the time she stopped breathing to leaving the room and getting the nurses. I don't even know if I stayed with her to say goodbye. That was exactly 1 week before I had my 2nd major surgery to fix a broken pelvis. So in addition to all that traumatic emotional baggage I have the physical and mental experience of 3 complicated and surgeries that left me with ongoing problems. And now my younger sister has an anaplastic astrocytoma (a malignant brain tumour) which is slowly killing her. It's a lot of $#%^ to handle and that's not even touching the childhood experience of being raised by a mother who was deeply histrionic or the other things I did or have had done to me outside of my family. TBH I wonder if that amount of negative experiences can even be resolved at my age (40's). NEGL, the urge to simply say \"###$ it\" and let the mask slip is just. so. tempting I mean, LBR, it's not like my life has worked out trying to comply with societies expectations. Anyway, sorry for the word vomit",
      "Sorry all that has happened to you, it's definitely a lot for anyone to handle.  I'm sure that when you think of it all together, it's totally overwhelming.  PTSD doesn't help as it causes much of it to remain present in your mind, and constantly re-lived. I know this may seem obvious/trivial, but it often helps to break things down to one step at a time.  Your PTSD will fight you on that, but there are some techniques you could learn to help.  Maybe the first step/goal would be getting to your therapist, even if you don't go anywhere else due to the agoraphobia.  Your focus could be just on achieving this one thing.  Then the therapist could begin to help you with other things, so this one first step enables others to follow, and eventually further progress. I'm sure you've thought of that and it's not as easily done as said.  But you kind of have to start somewhere, so maybe choose something simple that is achievable but helpful, and work from there. Try to keep it simple and focused, one thing at a time, and try to ignore the other stuff as best you can, until it's their turn. Anyway this is not much, but I hope it helps.  You mentioned your mother's unfortunate fate, you might keep that in mind as motivation to make sure you get the care you need.  It's important and you're totally deserving of it.  You can try to let the fear and anxiety be set aside briefly, and push yourself to make it happen.  I hope you will.",
      "Hang in there!  My son is bipolar and in trying different medications to help him, his doctor does Skype or FaceTime visits with him at home.  That way the doctor can see his mood without him having to put on his \"public face\" and wait for the next appointment.  It has helped him tremendously.  Also, do you have a dog?  My dog is a great companion to me.  Bumps me and gets my attention when I'm having a difficult time.  Just his touch is enough to calm me."

      "My trauma (life threatening, real) happened when I was 14. Repressed it. Knew something was there but couldn’t quite place a finger on it. When I was 36 it came back to me in bits and pieces. Very confusing but managed to understand it more and more.  I am now 58 and still suffer from night terrors and flashbacks. The flashbacks can be difficult because it’s like one ear and one eye are in one world and the other eye and ear are in the other world. So to me whatever reaction I have is the appropriate reaction. I have to really concentrate.  I would have thought by now I would have gotten over it already.  I’m not in danger any more (someone else died, not me, I lived!). Yet some nights I still wake up screaming and shaking.  Will it ever stop?",
      "That is a long time a very long time. Do you think the relationship you had with the person who did not make it brings it back into your life at times?",
      "I didn't know this person well.  We were talking but there was no relationship.  We were both victims of torture.  After witnessing her death and being covered in her gore, I knew I was next, but it didn't happen.  I lived.  I hear her screams every night.",
      "All I can say is that I feel for you, I really do, and the fact that you have not medicated yourself out of this world, is a credit to you. Have you ever been able to sit down and unload on the experience, with someone. It helps many of us (although I cannot say I have ever come across someone with your case ). Have you sought professional help at times? How did that go? (for some of us it great for others there is nothing worse).",
      "RapidMallard78 wrote: ... I knew I was next, but it didn't happen.  I lived.  I hear her screams every night. Have you ever worked with a therapist on \"Survivor Guilt\"?",
      "I did medicate myself quite heavily for many years, but have moved past that.  I'm now happily married have children, grandchildren, and even great grandchildren.  I did not go through any therapy, just talked about it some to some authorities, enough to know that it was in fact real and not me loosing my mind.  I knew there was some guilt there.  How could there not be.  Thinking I could have or should have done something different, but over the years have realized that it happened the way it happened and couldn't have been any different.  Thought I was over that guilt.  But since you mention it, I do try to let her see life through my eyes, so she can see the good and the joys she missed.  I'm still carrying her with me as part of me.  I feel obligated.  It doesn't feel right to just let her go into oblivion.  Is that the same as survivor guilt?",
      "I'm sure it doesn't feel it, but having flashbacks come back instead of repressing or dissociating the memory is actually your mind advancing the healing. You can't heal what you can't remember. And now, with flashbacks, the memories still aren't integrated into your normal memory where you can reflect on the experience without the full force of the trauma but it is an advance on where you were. What you have been through is difficult and traumatic and everyone has their own process and pace. RapidMallard78 wrote: I do try to let her see life through my eyes, so she can see the good and the joys she missed. I'm still carrying her with me as part of me. This is so moving to read...",
      "Thank you, that was helpful.  I've been fighting the flashbacks.  But maybe I should just go with the flow and ride it out.  More patience.",
      "RapidMallard78 wrote: It doesn't feel right to just let her go into oblivion.  Is that the same as survivor guilt? No it does not sound right and that is your humanity not survivors guilt. I have not had something like you but when I realised I was not abnormal, I was a normal person who had a very abnormal life, it got a lot better. Hope it does for you too.",
      "Thank you for your kind words.  I do feel better and maybe even a little stronger.  I do feel abnormal at times.  Your words are encouraging. And may you always wonder what you're made of and never have to find out..."

      "Hello all, adult child abuse survivor here. One of the most frustrating things I think about my trauma is that it's sometimes hard to remember it, or to remember exactly what happened, and I'm never sure if my memories are real or not. Like, what if I'm just making them up? Or what if I'm over-exaggerating them and thus giving myself PTSD based on false/amplified memories? But that's besides the point. My main concern right now is why I remember two different outcomes for a single event. It's really frustrating to not know which one is the correct one. For example, I recall one time my abuser trapped me in a closet, that I'm fairly sure of. But what happens next is up for debate. On the one hand, I remember next my abuser letting me out (with some... prodding from my mother.) But then, I also recall I, not him, letting myself out. So which one is the true one? Another one is this one time I remember my abuser chucking a huge exercise-type ball (dunno if it was actually an exercise ball or just looked like one) at my head. But I recall two different outcomes, one where he throws it and it misses/I dodge it, and one where it hits me in the head (and if you count having one memory where it hit me and I fell down and another where it hit me and I merely stumbled/didn't fall down, then I guess it's technically three outcomes that I recall.) So, does anyone know why this happens? Even if I can't determine which memory is the true one, at least knowing why this happens and that I'm not alone would help. Anyone else have any experience with remembering two outcomes to one event? And if so, what can I do about it? It's driving me nuts, not knowing for certain... Thanks to any who take the time to read and respond to it.",
      "I can't help with the two outcomes, but the event itself eats up a large chunk of memory. The feeling that these events convey is cortisol fueled. They leave large imprints when that cortisol is surging. It is part of our physiology. The need to recognize crisis so they don't repeat. That physiology is built around not being eaten by a  sabre tooth, not for  living in an abusive dysfunctional house. Your brain is remembering the critical point, not the walk back to the cave and what you had for dinner that night. Hope that makes some sense",
      "The brains ability to fill in missing information never fails to intrigue me.. what you're experiencing is pretty much this; When you look at something the mind organizes all of the visual information available into a single whole in an effort to provide meaning to elements in a sea of chaos. The gestalt effect is a ability of the brain to generate whole forms from groupings of lines, shapes, curves and points. (quoted piece stolen from the internet.. highlight and google it for more info) the gestalt effect is mostly an explanation for shapes etc..  but it explains what happens to our memories sometimes as well.  We (most of us) only remember a small amount of things that have happened in our lives, and as Terry said, we'll only really remember the experiences that had the greatest emotional impact.. so when we try to remember the not so emotionally strong parts of that experience,  sometimes it just isn't really there, and our brain fills in the blanks with what it views as the most likely (or desired) answer. Trust the bit of memories that don't change..  and don't worry too much if you only remember snapshots  - completely normal xx",

This information helps as well, it's reassuring I guess to know that it's normal at least and to have an explanation for it.",
      "In addition to the reasons given by Terry and Seabreeze above, another possibility is that your memory has merged multiple events together.  Both the events you mentioned may have occurred multiple times, with different outcomes.  But your mind has categorized them by the initiating event (being locked in the closet or having the ball thrown at you), and no longer differentiates individual instances, but does retain examples of the outcomes. I remember playing dodge ball in school and both great catches and being clobbered, but I could not tell you the specifics any longer.  I know I played and that there were various outcomes.  They are all blurred together in my memory and come to mind when the topic comes up.  I think that's pretty normal for events that happened awhile ago. Not sure if you are familiar with information storage theory, but multiple instances of similar events can be stored as a \"one\" record of the common factors, with the variations stored as \"related many\" records.  This is how most databases are structured, and your memory is somewhat like an archival database.  It's an efficient method of storage for complex datasets.",

Hello and thanks for replying, sorry for not responding sooner. That does make sense, and I am somewhat familiar with how the brain processes and stores information. I think I may have wound up trapped in the closet more than once (among other places). But, the weird thing is that the ball being thrown at me only happened once, I think. But, I suppose, human memories are not perfect. It is true that other instances of abuse are no longer clear in my mind and I can recall them but not which order they occurred in. Not really, anyway. So I suppose that answers my question, although it is still a bit frustrating not knowing for sure... I guess mostly, and I think I said this in my original post too, that I'm afraid of accidentally making up abuse, or exaggerating it to be worse in my head than it really was. Thanks for the answers, to you and everyone. I think it's safe to say this post can be closed. (Dunno if there's an actual mechanism for that or if posts just fade into obscurity on the forums but whatever, lol.)"

      "I wonder if anyone knows of any groups for people abused by medical professionals. I am from Finland originally, but have also lived in the US. I have lived in FInland for the past year and before that I lived in Chicago. I was abused by  a doctor at the *mod edit* in Northern Finland when given too much fentanyl after falling off a horse and fracturing four ribs in January this year. I was nearly unconscious and a female doctor (ca 50 years old) asked me disgusting sexual questions in front of 9 people and provoked me to talk about sexual things nobody would ever discuss with any stranger, while I was heavily sedated. Nine people were watching and nobody intervened. Actually on the contrary, two older nurses (a male and a female) urged the female doctor to continue and I was abused even more. I have been truly traumatized by this and have been in trauma therapy for three months now. I wonder if you know of any support group or of any people with similar situation to mine that I could talk to. I have not received any proper therapy in Finland and a very unprofessional female psychiatrist just almost dismissed my case (yesterday 6.2.2017) as I was not able to tell her much about what had happened. She pretty much just sent me home. Would really appreciate your help as I have noticed that I have the symptoms of PTSD that can be quite severe and have lasted for way too long. Talking to other people with similar experiences I think could be of great benefit. Hopefully you have time to get in touch Best Liisa",
      "If you have trouble seeking help from a professional, like with the psychiatrist you visited, it can help to write down your experiences and symptoms. This way, if you are having trouble talking about the problem, you are able to give your notes to the person treating you in order to give them a better idea of what the problems are that you are experiencing. I am sorry to hear of your experiences. Most countries have somewhere that you can report unprofessional conduct by doctors. It might be worth you looking into who you could speak to about what happened.",
      "Thank you for your reply salted lipstick. I received an answer today from the Finnish medical board. I sent a complaint about the behavior of the personnell and was told that none of this abuse has occured. This is SUCH a lie. I still remember this situation vividly. I remember all the 9 people present, I remember the discussions, everything and they just lie. I have had to go to therapy for months due to this and I am still suffering the symptoms of PTSD, getting panick attacks for the first time in my life. I would not get these symptoms unless something really happened. I spoke with the local police today and they were helpful. However, I know the names of most of the people that were present that day. I hope to God they suffer for what they have done. I also know that they will be punished maybe not today, but for sure karma will catch upon them sooner or later. I am not giving up however, I will still make a complaint and push this forward with the police. I will make this public in Finland and abroad. What kind of a ape country Finland is how can they allow things like this to happen. And no one intervenes. Well it is a clear indication that doctors and medical staff are allowed to do anything they please, but no problem, lets just keep this in mind. Many thank to the \"people\" who took such a \"good\" care of me at the *mod edit* Hospital. Stay FAR away from that Place it is scary. You will come home abused and traumatized. I think people like the medical staff at the *mod edit* Hospital have ruined the country I was born in. Shame on you",
      "I hear your anger. I have been there. Many times. Yes, by medical doctors. Until we realize this works is full of wounded children walking around in adults’ bodies (myself included), we will never get past our anger. They are little kids. Also what is the lesson here? I don’t know the details but for me it was always getting up immediately and saying. “Thank you for your time.” And walking out. Something would keep my butt plastered in the chair every time I was with someone hurtful. And oftentimes I would return. If we have to switch doctors several times then we do that. But the best way to not have to deal with doctors is this: get healthy. There are subtle things that can cause us to be vulnerable too. Being alone is one of them. Again, if we want to have friends or mates, we have to be healthy. I relate to this plight. Many do. This doesn’t excuse other people’s behavior it just helps me get out of those situations. Much love to you. Let this go. Get the lesson and move on from these people. Oh, and I also tried fuming a medical board complaint. In the middle of it I had a revelation and I sent them a letter saying I left this where it belongs, in my past. That ought to have ticked off the doctor well! (Hee hee. I’m a brat, I know:) )",

      "With 9/11 approaching, my husband (married for 4 years and his 15 year son lives with us), who has PTSD, has been having horrible nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety, and hyper-vigilance.  He is also taking all of this out on me.  I went away on a girls' weekend the beginning of May with my high school girlfriends, one of whom is a recent cancer survivor, and he is accusing me of cheating that weekend and up until this day. I work and he says that I am doing sexual things with everyone at work and the office building.  He is nice to everyone but me.  He is condescending, manipulative, and nasty to me calling me horrible things.   I know this is a very difficult time for him; however, I am at a complete loss at what to do and I am mentally exhausted.  Why does he treat me like this and does anyone have suggestions on how to cope and not take this personally?",
      "This sounds like he is doubting your reasons for wanting to be with him.  He may view himself as so messed up that he thinks you must be looking around for something better than him.  So my guess is this is more about how he views himself, than how he views you. The PTSD doesn't help, it reinforces his belief that there is something wrong with him, and you can't want to be with him.  It's common for people with severe PTSD to go down this road of self-blame and lashing out at others.  That path needs to be interrupted, in any way you can. I think counseling could help a lot here, a professional could help him identify this trend within himself and develop a different viewpoint, that is closer to reality.  The truth is that he is not awful, but some of the things he is reliving in his head are.  So if you can get him some support, that would be great.  He may resist so enlisting others to convince him might help (a unified front).  Also talking to someone who has been through this process, so that he sees success is possible.  Most people going in think it won't help, but it very obviously does. There are numerous resources available to him, through the department even if he is retired.  He just needs help reaching out.  He's not the first 9/11 responder that's needed help, he's in good company there.  You might ask the department to refer you to some of them, they will definitely want to help both you and him.",
      "Never thought of it from that perspective.  It makes sense.  I really appreciate you taking the time to respond to my post.",
      "That behavior is all about untreated PTSD.  He is having what we call emotional flashbacks and since 9/11 was then and this is now, he is connecting something, [i]anything [/i], in the here-and-now to those feelings he is having now that \"come out of nowhere\".  In psychology jargon he is making a cognitive error.  Most people experiencing flashbacks do that, until they have been in treatment long enough to recognize that they are having flashbacks. I have been there, done that. There is help available, for him and for you.  Reach out to resources local to you.  If you have trouble finding local resources, the Veterans Association PTSD center or NAMI may be able to help you find those resources. Competent treatment for PTSD is quite effective."

      "How can I get better from all the trauma that I have experienced (I’m talking hundreds of events starting from when I was really young) when I have blacked out probably 90% of what has happened and only have an extremely vague recollection of things happening, and even then I don’t really know what???? I’m sick of having flashbacks that don’t make sense. I think back to my high school bullying and while it hurts and I get swept right back there I can’t really remember anything truly significant that happened. Same with most of my life... But I’m only in my early 20’s and this stuff has impacted on me so much so it bothers me immensely that I can’t talk about it and move on.  and I feel that it’s hopeless to even try therapy again because how can I talk about what I don’t remember? I’m never going to get better.",
      "talk therapy is not the only approach that helps. by now there are a lot of different techniques to trauma therapy that can cause you to get better and reduce symptoms even if you don't have access to all of your memories. sometimes body-focussed approaches like sensorimotor therapy, somatic experiencing, concentrative movement therapy or even trauma-sensitive yoga can help. they are mostly non-verbal and don't need you to know your full trauma history. EMDR can also be used with fragments of experience, including emotional states or body sensation. it doesn't require whole scenes. The bilateral stimulation often reduces dissociative barriers,  that means that you might get access to memories you used to dissociate. this is one way to recover memories without using hyponosis. it is not unusual for people to start to remember more over time. You are still young. Memory often comes up as you develop a tolerance for knowing things. if you can find a skilled trauma therapist they can teach you all kinds of exercises and techniques to manage your flashbacks and regulate yourself. it is worth trying. you obviously don't need to know any details to show the symptoms of PTSD. and you don't need to know the details to learn how to cope with these symptoms. Don't give up hope. There is a lot that can be done to help.",

      "I deal with this as well, and honestly, therapy was a joke in my opinion, they just throw drugs at you until you are so sedated you can't function, it's really sad and I think healing should be ... more honest and less about making money off the mentally ill... as far as knowing you had trauma that you can't remember, I have that too, only little flashbacks of stuff that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, some stuff people told me happened that I can kinda remember but not really, and honestly i'd rather not remember some of the sick stuff I had to go through as a child , i mean i'm screwed up enough remembering the stuff i do remember, maybe my brain understands that it's too much for me to handle, or maybe i was just too young to really comprehend and remember , there is the....   \"regression therapy\" option, but man, theres no way i wannna relive stuff like that, no way."

      "I am used to the guy I like keeping me at a distance, pushing me away, trying to sabotage our friendship, etc. but I've just hung in there, like a kid on a roller-coaster (haha). The other day, he accused me of not having been there for him when he was at his lowest (yet he is very good at saying 'no' to invitations to do anything, which I generally take in my stride). I told him I am there for him and he deserves unconditional love and care because he is worthy. I told him he deserves to feel safe and respected. And he changed! He reads and replies to my messages timeously. He is kind to me all the time. He said before he didn't trust me and he expected me to just go away, like everyone else before me. He said it will take time for him to slowly begin to trust and reach out, as he's never known what that's like. He said he did what he did out of pain, because it's easier to be alone than to suffer. We made a plan to meet for coffee tomorrow (if he doesn't make it, I won't hold it against him, but he actually suggested it, which hasn't happened, well, ever!). We discussed going on a hike, just the two of us, to a very secluded place and even talked about hiring a cottage to stay in (with our own rooms, as we're miles and miles from a relationship yet). He said he is trying his best and has control over his behaviour, except where he needs to retreat into himself when he doesn't feel great. He said his friends don't always understand that need and problems arise. He has two friends whom he's known for 15 years - no other friends! I realise that expecting too much too soon is inappropriate, so I'm managing expectations and just continuing to be his friend, no matter what (although I did tell him that I would never accept insults or abuse - and he's never dished 'em out). It feels really good to know he's slowly trusting that I won't hurt him or leave him.",
      "I'm smiling here - that's such good news (: We can definitely be difficult to get to know,  but i'm so so glad you're understanding enough to give him the time and space he needs xx"

      "I think I have ptsd but haven’t been diagnosed and therapy is just opening up cans of worms I was barely ready for. Today after being triggered by a friend who I vented to about my sexual assault, knew about the way in which it destroyed me, and how I became hyper sexual as a cause of it and extremely depressed because I had to let him go free on circumstantial evidence. He knew it all, And was there for me, then asked me to have sex with him for the third time that I declined like a broken record saying that I wanted a relationship if I were to ever have sex again. After it my chest started hurting, as I was in shock, and threw my phone, that proceeded with crying. I was driving, and then all of a sudden I snap back into it and I’m in the middle of the street with the light being dead red. Couple things- Was this a flashback, or just normal reaction and if it was why did being asked for sex trigger one.",
      "I had a similar experience few years back. I was working for a company as an intern. Upon realization that I was working a full time job for a derisory salary, I asked for a pay rise. The HR, who was the CEO's wife, met with me and tried to guilt me into keeping the current salary using all kinds of abusing verbal tactics. My mind went blank, I just left the room in direction of my computer, livid, without a word, leaving her to her monologue. She went right to her husband's office to complain and they fired me on the spot. I was so shocked by the unfairness of it all that, after this episode, I had a few emotionally erratic hours. Sitting here looking back, I know that I just hated what was being done to me, that it reminded me of treatments I received when I was little, and that instead of processing my emotions I went to automatic settings in some sort of flight-freeze manner, my emotions spurting out messily in the aftermath. Nowadays I would react differently but again looking back, and without smartassing you, I find that my reaction was the normal reaction of someone who's been abused.",
      "Disassociation -can be the default setting with triggers. I am sorry about what happened. The bad stuff keeps bouncing around.",
      "I feel bad departing further from your topic Nohone, but the description of your episode brought more memories today on my side. I just remembered that before leaving the premises, the CEO and his wife had me come to his office. They wanted me to sign some papers stipulating that I had made the decision to leave on my own, so as not to pay me the wage they'd owe for the remnant of the month and protect themselves from legal issues, since they were legally bound to give me a notice. The papers were in a foreign language, since I was living abroad, that to this day I do not speak. I refused so the guy pretended reaching out for his phone, threatening to call the cops. I left the room again and went looking for my stuffs in order to leave for good. But this time they were waiting for me in the hallway, the man, brandishing the papers, was vociferating something about calling his lawyers... Anyway I don't mean to minimize the traumatic experience that happened to you by evaluating it against mine. I just find it striking how much it impacted me at the time versus if it happened now. It strikes me today that some clowns really aren't worth dissociating over, although it may take a while to reach this conclusion."

      "Hello: my therapist diagnosed me with bpd and mdd, but i personally think i relate more to ptsd and mdd, however, my traumas were emotional rather than physical and im afraid ill be ridiculed if i mention that as i read the DSM and the examples of traumas mentioned were only physical/sexual ones. so is it possible to even develop ptsd from non physical traumas?",
      "I'm going to move your thread over to the PTSD section so that members with PTSD are more likely to see your post and respond.. But absolutely yes..   although i've been physically and sexually abused,  most of the layers of my c-PTSD come from my childhood - which was incredibly full of emotional abuse (severe neglect as well).. Please spend some time reading through the PTSD section here..  and join in where-ever you feel comfy enough xx",
      "bump",
      "BPD and PTSD have a couple of symptoms in common. Both can have an element of neglect and emotional abuse as a root. It needs proper diffential diagnosis, but it is very common to have both. Trauma is not what happens. Trauma is our physical and psychological response to extreme stress. Usually trauma is caused by perceived danger or lack of choice in a situation. Situations that force certain responses without offering any choices whatsoever combined with strong emotions like fear, anger, despair etc could result in a limited psychological processing of the situation. When extreme stress keeps us from processing situations properly it will cause symptoms of PTSD. Some people manage to process even sexual violence and don't get PTSD. I know someone who was unable to process her parents divorce and developed PTSD and BPD from it. It's not about the event, it is about how we manage to deal with it. The more extreme the stress the greater the chance that we don't process the situation well. So yes, there is a chance to develop PTSD from non-physical trauma, it is just statistically less likely and depends on individual capacities. Capacities are lower in children because they lack mental maturity needed for processing. ."

      "Is this normal? A bit of a weird title I guess since I don’t really like the word normal. I guess what I’m asking is, are my experiences similar to yours and are they typical of cptsd? I’m new to this part of the forum. Spend most of my time here on the bpd forum. I’ve just been diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Unofficially I think, cptsd is still not an officially recognised diagnosis am I correct in saying? I’m struggling to make sense of what is happening to my mind. I go through periods where I hardly think about my trauma. And when I say hardly think of it, it’s as if it never happened. I still am extremely jumpy, I’m triggered by things that put me back there. I have flashbacks. But, right now for example, it’s as if I can’t remember the whole thing. In my case, an extremely messed up and physically and emotionally abusive relationship.... I have ENORMOUS distrust in the world, I always have done (I’ve just been diagnosed bpd too... I think it comes from that), but it’s now... unlike never before. I feel the entire world is evil. To the point of mild paranoia. I don’t trust ANYONE at all. Not one tiny bit. I have severe numbness. It’s awful. Again, I had the emptiness before, a lot, but I think that was the bpd again. Now, it feels like brain damage. But, what seems to keep happening is, I will be numb for ages, I will feel nothing about what happened to me, I’ll barely remember it, it feels as though it didn’t really happen, then all of a sudden, the feelings will hit me and I’ll be in flight mode again. I’ll pace around. I’ll be panicky. Every little sound makes me jump and prepares my body for pain. My heart races. My palms sweat. I become full of adrenaline. I get chest pain too. And often this is accompanied by intense rage. INTENSE rage. Worryingly intense. I feel there’s so much I’ve got to do. I feel worried. Like something terrible or life threatening is going to happen any second despite the fact I’m ‘safe’ in a house. But then, it goes. I go back to nothing. I forget. It’s all gone. Like right now for example. It’s different. I have been panicky this evening again. Adrenaline pumping. Sounds setting me off. Pacing about. But I can’t remember anything. If I think about the relationship I can’t feel it. I can’t even remember details properly. It feels like the entire relationship didn’t happen. I’m questioning all sorts. I’m really confused. And I don’t like it. It’s making me mad. Am I going to remember or is this it now? Will it just gradually fade from my brain and all I’ll be left with is symptoms? Is it even still in my brain? Or is it being erased and that’s why remembering and connecting with it seems to be getting more and more difficult as time goes on? Up until now, when it hit me again, it hit me hard and I did remember. But as time goes by, I seem to be forgetting. Like it really really feels like it didn’t happen right now. But at the same time it does. Is this typical of cptsd? -- Tue Jun 26, 2018 2:12 am -- I think I’m basically dissociating aren’t I. But it’s like semi permanent dissociation. It’s almost like it’s always there. Except for sometimes when it comes back. I think what’s happening is it starts to come back and then my brain is finding it so stressful it dissociates it away so I can’t feel it, cause it knows I can’t handle it. I don’t wana dissociate. I wana get mad. But then when I do, it feels like my body is not big enough to contain my rage. And there’s no outlet. So it goes back in.",
      "That sounds very normal for dissociation. You might like to chat about the dissociative aspects of your experiences on the Dissociative Identity Disorder forum, where it's pretty active and you'll get lots of input and help to understand your dissociation better. Even if your dissociation is falling under the banner of your BPD it can be helpful to understand the dissociation more so that you are more comfortable with it, that's why I'd suggest talking a bit more there. It's always a bit quieter here...",
      "I agree with Salted but as a child abuse PTSD person you kind of describe my normal default mode when younger. Especially the trust part. I have gotten better in that I don't distrust people as much but I doubt I will ever have trust as a default. .. and as I wound up an accountant who swims with sharks of the business world it is not always a bad thing",
      "yes, it is kind of normal. There is a huge overlap in cPTSD and BPD and structural dissociation. What you describe could be easily explained using the concept of structural dissociation, that there is a part of you who manages every day life and that there are one or more emotional parts who carry certain memories and vehement emotions. It doesn't mean that you have DID. This is usually seen in cPTSD and BPD. But the concept of inner children or emotional parts might help you to make sense of what is going on and find ways to cope in taking care of these parts. it is incredibly common for trauma survivors. You are not alone.",
      "It’s back. All of a sudden it’s ALL back. I don’t know what triggered exactly but I have an idea.... I’m awake to it all again... I can’t believe I’ve been asleep to it for so long. I’ve been screaming, laughing hysterically, running round my house. Panicking. My mind was blocking it all out. And it’s all back. I don’t know how long it’ll be back for. I was dead to it before. I didnt care. Now all of a sudden I can’t believe how I didn’t care. I’m enraged and I’m so angry with this f*cked up world. I feel sick. Sick to my stomach at the world. I feel like I should feel like this all the time. But I guess that’s why I block it out, cause if I felt like this all the time I literally would not function. I’d just scream at people. My adrenaline is hurting my brain. It’s so ###$ up. I feel like someone has just punched me in the head. I feel like I should be really concerned! Like I’m an idiot for not connecting with it before when I could be in serious danger right now. I don’t understand! But then I’m also thinking, am I overreacting and this is just the ptsd? Is it making me think and feel like I need to panic and take some preventative measures to protect myself. ###$. I really think I need to speak to someone about this but I don’t know who... And I don’t wanna go out my house like this cause I feel too vulnerable and feel like if someone looks at me in wrong way I might lose it. I feel like everyone is a potential threat. And no one believes me. No one understands. My brain hurts! It feels like it’s on fire. My heads pounding.

My flashbacks were treated in a therapy session based on re-exposure that proved highly effective.  In those sessions I relived the event over and over until it minimized the fear.  My primary nightmare and flashbacks at that time, was being held against my will and having a pitbull attack me.  They trained me to relive the experience in therapy, only the pitbull was viewed as a miniature poodle to minimize my fear.  After talking about it, my reactions to it, and all the surrounding feelings, over and over, the fear became less and less.  I won't lie.  I missed a few sessions because those days I felt I couldn't deal with reliving it from time to time.  But I went back and made it through the sessions.  At the end, I was suggested to get a small dog for a companion.  I did and although I still have reservations about pitbulls, I now no longer have those nightmares. The emotions attached to those flashbacks and nightmares have been minimized too.  It's tough to go through, but it is highly effective.  Therapy was the key.  They have several forms of treatment than can accommodate that.  I was also attending group therapy sessions.  Hope that is helpful.",

      "I have come here after a very traumatic encounter – it was traumatic enough for me – which happened almost 2 years ago. I have a long-term illness which has not been very well managed or controlled. The job I had at the time did not help my illness either but I did not recognise this at the time. The shifts were sporadic, started early morning (about 7-8am), ended at teatime (around about 7-8pm) and required me to drive 12 miles from home – that was the combined mileage I would accrue in one day. No one would cover my shifts, meaning only I could go and do the work no one else was able to. This went on from March 2015 to July 2016. I got in touch with a friend who recommended I work for her boss. So I was offered the chance to work for her immediately. Unfortunately the shifts were non-stop, requiring me to do the following jobs: 7:30am – 8:30am 8:30am – 9:30am 9:30am – 10:30am 10:30am –11:30am 11:30am-12:30pm 12:30pm-1:30pm 7:30pm-8:30pm 8:30pm-9:30pm 9:30pm-10:30pm I made a lot of errors, I did not sleep very well and my weight plummeted from 50kg to 44kg. I was not told about certain things that had happened for specific shifts or things that I should have done and I resigned before my boss had a chance to sack me on the spot. I was in the job 6 weeks. On my last shift I handed back to my boss everything she provided me with – uniform, supplies etc. I thanked her for the opportunity only to be interrupted by her and I was told I am my own worst enemy and she went through every single negative thing about me that she could think of. Her negative assessment of me went on for about 2 minutes or so before she threatened – twice – to report me and then wished me luck for the future. I said thank you again only for her to slam her car door and disappear down the road. I went back to the employer I left – I had no money and I knew that I did well despite the shifts being sporadic – and they happily took me on, only for the other boss to find out and send to them a bad reference about me, resulting in them to sack me on the spot. So the way things stand for me at the moment are a lot better – I qualified with a vocational qualification funded by Jobseeker's Allowance (UK dole office) and I have been working on an agency contract in my current job for over a year – the contract was only meant to have been for 3 months. My confidence has really gone up and I have been looking better since I have been able to afford better food, better health support through supplements etc. My weight is now the heaviest it has been, 56.9kg and everyone has said how well I look. I have also gained a lot of friends. But what the second manager said still affects me. It has become a trigger in that whatever mistake I make I still feel the same negative emotions back then, 2 years ago, flood back. I am not only hurt by the things she said, but also angry and want to get her back for the way she made me feel. She said things like I didn't look the sort to have the illness I have, that I was making the illness up, that the diagnosis was wrong, and that one of the clients called me names and she readily told me the names she called me. I just feel like I am going crazy but I guess this also makes me feel lonely and isolated and so that's why I'm here. I don't know why the triggers are still there, or if I need medication or not. I have been on fluoxetine before when the doctor thought it had put me into depression and I felt very emotionally numb on it and I couldn't think straight at all. Thanks for reading, sorry for long post."

      "I am black, and was abused as a kid by my mom and male family members. Ever since I've been afraid of older black men, I've never told anyone about this and have always repressed my physical reactions to being around them when I'm around others. I've also had gender disturbances, when I went through puberty I wanted to bind my chest and wore over sized clothes to hide my body. I ultimately wanted to be agender but this changed once I realised removing my breasts would be impossible. I still struggle with my body/ I no longer live with family but still have the same responses around strangers who are older black men. It's so bad if I'm on a train, I will get up and move carriages, or at a bus stop I will make sure to keep my distance. Sitting in the library and I will pack up and leave. I don't feel this way around older white men, although I still feel suspicious, I don't panic, cry uncontrollably, and feel trapped. It's destroying my life. Can anyone else relate?",
      "sorry i'm only just replying, but yes.. i can relate,  and i've seen a few other members that have the same problem so you're not alone. It's not racism - it's more a phobia of a specific trigger..   if you'd been in a car accident and had PTSD from that, it's likely that the worst trigger for you would be the same make of car. i wanted to be agender for a long time as well - or more accurately, i didn't want anyone looking at me in that way, and i couldn't stand my body..  i hid in baggy clothes (and honestly was envious of women that wore burkhas..). Can i ask.. do you know any older black men at all that you can stand being around for a short time? xx"

Not too certain about this now i'm thinking about it actually, but i mentioned to my mother a few years ago that i was considering it (for reasons relating to suspected poor medical care by doctors), and she told me that my records had somehow gone missing when we moved areas.  Apparently when the new doctor had requested them, the old doctors said they had gone missing. This was back when medical records weren't yet stored on computer. Perhaps I was naive in just believing and not considering asking the doctors though..  don't see why she'd lie about that, but i guess it's possible so worth exploring. salted lipstick wrote: This is really interesting. Thanks for mentioning, I hadn't heard of psychogenic fever before. I'm kind of wondering now if some of the fever symptoms I've been experiencing might have something to do with this... I don't get flu symptoms specifically but I do occasionally get fever for no apparent reason. i'm sorry you get fevers like that if it is that, i guess the way to avoid them is to reduce stress and try to avoid internalising (not a simple thing at all though if you're anything like me and withdraw rather than opening up and asking for support - i do definitely need to try and reduce stress though) and definitely takes time to see if things can become clearer sometimes.. sometimes with flashbacks i'm right back there and can remember everything about an experience.. but then after the flashbacks goes.. the memories kind of go with it.  Don't know if that makes sense at all..  difficult to explain.. closest i can describe it is like dreams..   where the memory is vivid when you first wake, but then it fades as you come back to consciousness.  Except that with these memory flashbacks, they don't stay faded forever..   the memory kind of seeps in gradually and the gap gets fuller..  and then i realise that bit isn't really missing anymore. (and that probably makes absolutely no sense to anyone.. ) xx",
      "Hi, yes I suffer with flu like symptoms after I have nightmares and flashbacks. It also heightens my ptsd symptoms. My nightmares and flashbacks get worse during the period of the flu like state. My nose feels blocked, aches and pains. I don’t think there is much that can be done about it to be honest. I have asked my CPN about it and they said it is quite common with ptsd sufferers. I hope this helps, I know it’s not much info but ....",

      "So when I was a child, I was abused by my older brother who was about 14 or so years older than me (yes, my parents had us far apart. I have another brother who's older than me but younger than the one that abused me.) He abused me physically and emotionally, and possibly sexually. I say possibly because I'm not sure. He never touched me in a sexual way or made suggestive remarks towards me, but he did make fun of and tease me about my developing body once I hit puberty, mainly about my breasts. I also recall him spanking me once or twice when I was a kid as punishment, and even though he didn't intend it in a sexual way and I was too young to know what sex was, it still felt violating and humiliating. I remember the violation and humiliation more than I remember the pain. That's not the point though. The point is, I've been seeing a therapist about this for years and dealing with it, but only relatively recently I've begun having bad dreams about my brother. I'm not sure if you could call them PTSD dreams or not, I've never been formally diagnosed with PTSD. These dreams also aren't flashbacks of the things he did to me, but new scenarios created from the memories of what he did to me, I guess, as well as my fears and concerns regarding him. These dreams, I think, only really started or became more common after my nephew was born about a year ago. My brother and his wife had a baby, and I admit I've been worried about him abusing his son. For now it seems like he's turned over a new leaf, he hasn't hurt me in a long time and he seems to be nicer now and friendlier towards me. I haven't seen any overt abusive behavior from him towards his child, but still I can't help but worry. I don't know if my sister-in-law knows about what he used to do to me. Either way, I plan on protecting the child and keeping a close eye on him. If my brother tries anything funny, I swear I will protect my nephew and be the first to call the police on him. I won't let him do to my dear nephew what he did to me. Still, these dreams, why am I having them now? You'd think if I were going to have PTSD dreams I'd have had them years ago, not now. If these even are PTSD dreams, idk. I also don't know if it makes a difference but of the dreams I've had since my nephew's birth I've had about three, I think, regarding my brother and my worries. In the first I was hiding from my brother, like I used to when I was little and he was on one of his rampages, but I was an adult as I am now and holding my nephew, protecting him. In the second my brother became famous, or was going to anyway, and I worried that nobody would listen to me if I were to tell them about how he abused me. I was afraid others may not believe me or may trivialize my abuse, saying that what he did was just one little bad thing compared to this other great thing he did to become famous. The third, and most recent, was one in which it was just me and my brother and he got angry and tried to/did spank me for misbehaving. What does it mean? Is this a good or bad thing, that I'm having these dreams? And are they actual PTSD dreams, or something else? Do I have PTSD? Sorry for the long post, and thanks so much to anyone who responds to it!",
      "I'm going to give you my 2 cents very quickly, based on my still limited understanding of C-PTSD (so not PTSD, that I'm not familiar with). C-PTSD dreams, imo, are very dark dreams, sometimes incomprehensible. You may wake up very scared. They're incomprehensible and very symbolic because they come straight from the unconscious. You may still feel very distraught a long time after you wake up. Your dreams seem different, they sound more like regular nightmares, more literal, the kind I experience now that I'm in touch with my feelings, the kind that express quasi-conscious fears. Hope this helps a little - I can't tell whether you're suffering from PTSD or not though, this is not something I'm able to determine here."

      "To cut a long story short, I have PTSD due to family violence starting which persisted for most of my child hood, my oldest memory is of my dad severely beating my mother, I spent most of my childhood scared and anxious (though no Dr recognized it as anything) There has been several other traumas over my 36 years in hell which have all made me the mess I am today. Anyhow, I am getting very dishearted and frustrated with psychs and Drs not taking my concerns re SSRI/SNRI seriously.  I've been on several and they all cause delayed orgasm (2-3 hours delay) no orgasm at all or numbness. I was put on Mirtazapine for this reason in 2013 as I refused the former, I had to go off it due to putting on 15KG, next was Bupropion, at the time I had started taking seroqual for insomnia, the Buproprion worked wonders for my mood however the seroqual caused me to be like a zombie all the time even on 7.5mg so I stopped, it was then I discovered the Bupropion (just 150mg at 6am) was causing me to lay awake until 3 - 5am.  I ended up coming off it and over the last six months have crashed pretty bad, I contemplate suicide daily etc. I asked my GP about Moclobemide which she can't prescribe and got the speech about food, I told her it's a reversible MAOI but she insisted I may not be able to eat some cheese I will likely never eat. I went to a psych yesterday, gave him my history, the referal mentioned the sexual side effects of SSRI and SNRI and that I wanted to try a MAOI (no mention of Moclobemide) again the speech about cheese and fish, I mentioned Moclobemide again and he said all MAOI's do it and refused to prescribe it before putting me on, drum roll. Prozac (the drug commonly prescribed for premature ejaculation) and Lithium. AND, though I said it never has as effect on me he prescribed valium to counteract the stimulating effect of Prozac, I currently take Zopiclone to sleep and he wants to put me on a drug that will make sleeping worse. Naturally I've left wanting my money back.  He said if I have sexual side effects he can give me Viagra, I said that won't do me much good being it's not erection issues. So I have another expensive appointment in 4 weeks where I will likely be going in having stopped Prozac on day 1 and am not sure about the Lithium. Why could he not just prescribe Moclobemide, and why was the not sleeping and sexual side effects just ignored? he was more keen to destroy my brain (I work in IT) with ECT than prescribe Moclobemide.",
      "Dude got to get off the drugs. Be your own doctor. Look at anything else, meditation, exercise, nutrition, therapy support groups, talking about it. Maybe collecting/hoarding for a while. My story is extreme long term physical abuse and domestic violence. Triggered \"child abuse Cushings Syndrome\", I still have occasional nightmares (I am in my 60s, and occasional hyper arousal and hyper vigilance is much more common than I would like. Zero trust, and have made peace with my self esteem) but would not trade that for what you are going through on your medical merry go round even if it got rid of all of that.",
      "Hi Adanuff, I have to say firstly that the fact you are struggling sexually and this being ignored is more than a little frustrating for you I'm afraid. A lot of clinicians see you as a 'problem', i.e. they diagnose you, they give you something to make problem A better which as far as they are concerned all that really matters. This entirely negates your quality of life though. Do you NEED all of that medication. What the hell are you on lithium for? If you're depressed then by all means explore SSRI to improve your conditions. Lithium, Prozac, Valium, Zoplicone. I'm amazed you can even remember your name! I've been on the medical merry go round as Terry E alludes to and it never made things better, it either made me delusional, confused, numb, insomniac or zombie. What you need is therapy, CBT, REBT or a form of actual treatment. There comes a point in life where we have to engage our brains to fix our brains. I am not judging you by any means. If the medication helps you then by all means take it, but I would seriously consider speaking with a consultant psychiatrist who TREATS PTSD, not a general doctor with no knowledge of the medications or their interactions. I hope you find a solution and always know that there are people that feel you pain. I as a woman on SSRIs had NO libido and also struggled to EVER orgasm, they are known to affect libido and arousal as a side effect. Exercise, nutrition and talking are what keep me sane (ish) these days. All the best. Amber",
      "Hi all, just an update. Well I ended up in emergency after putting a belt around my neck. Went to psych who finally prescribed mocloblemide and told me don't eat any cheese, or yeast extract etc etc, dr said the same thing, chemist info mentioned nothing about food. I had to wait another 4 weeks for the prozac that I didn't want to get out of my system before starting it and the psych upped the lithium to 900mg. 5 days later it started, impotence and loss of sensation so I spoke to GP a few days later who said I could go off it, like I was asking.. My other reasons for stopping the stuff was it flared up my IBS which had been and is now again under control, caused some nerve pain in my hands and feet and my throat felt dry and sore constantly despite the 4-5 litres of water a day. At the time of the sexual difficulties I had not taken the mocloblemide but am now on 450mg a day, after struggling to get the psych and gp to put me on the therapeutic dose, I had started on half the normal starting dose to begin with. The Mocloblemide seems to be helping my mood and I'm eating tons of cheese, Salami, yeast extract and all the stuff the DR and psych were terrified of with no ill effects. My issue now is I wish I'd never allowed them to give me the Lithium, the sexual side effects which started on Lithium before Mocloblemide have not subsided, there has been mild improvement but it's still bothering me to the point I've just stopped trying, my wife and I usually have sex 3-4 times a week now I struggle with in once a week because I feel embarrassed and ashamed.  Has anyone else had this from Lithium and if so does it ever get better?  I have never ever had these sorts of problems except delayed orgasm when very drunk, we always say we won't do it when drunk lol, I even struggle when watching porn so it's not anything to do with my wife, my erections are bendy now and the sensitivity is reduced, all since Lithium..  When I raised it with the GP and said I want to go off it she said it's performance anxiety, something I rarely if ever have so why would it start now and continue for weeks? I was prescribed Lithium for treatment resistant depression which I told them I don't have, how can it be resistant if you stop taking the meds they gave you before they could have any effect? I mentioned Bupropion worked well but caused insomnia but in going over my med history the psych said well that one didn't work?? Needless to say I refuse to see him again.",
      "If you are having trouble with the physical side of sex steer away from porn .Google porn addiction. it messes with arousal.",
      "I don't have an addiction to porn, I was just pointing out that suddenly even it's not doing anything so it's not a sudden loss of interest in my wife.",
      "Well if you are telling them you have a porn addiction they are not going to care and quite honestly most psychiatrists even women ones are d*cks. In my experience. I have only had one my enter life thst wasnt and im 41. I also agree that they look at you like a problem."

It feels bizzare and it harms relationships How long has it been since you were in the situation that gave you the c-PTSD? (assuming and hoping that you're no longer in that situation of course). I'm only just really starting to be able to let go and have fun..   just starting to be able to relax and enjoy chatting without constantly analying everything they and myself are doing and saying. I'm about 20 years out now though..  it's a long, tough road but it's certainly possible to get your hypervigilance down to a more manageable level eventually. I wonder if you and Terry get drunk like normal people seem to, or if like me, being drunk just leaves your body unable to do what it should, but your mind still has a stone cold sober centre in control of your thoughts.. (?) One thing that i found the most helpful with the hypervigilance and building relationships with others, is learning to trust myself, and to believe that i'm capable of knowing who to trust. Every time in the past that i've ignored my instincts,  it's ended badly..  now i listen to myself every time, and can relax a bit more. I do struggle a fair bit with black-white thinking and emotions though..   like if i find out that someone has lied about something, i'll really struggle not to go off them completely.. That needs work still, but i'm hopefully part-way through that one.",
      "comparing yourself with people without trauma must be stressful. what you describe is part of cPTSD it takes a while to learn and unlearn. you don't have to suddenly become spontaneous. but you can slowly learn how to have planned enjoyment and figure out if there are things that you might like a little bit better than other things. it takes time to experiment and compare your experience. the learning happens with making new experiences. it is slow but possible. it is similar with learning how to reduce the hypervigilance. it takes baby steps of allowing a little relaxation. maybe just letting go in the shoulders for a moment. active ways of relaxation like qi gong or yoga might be easier than others. for a while we took lyrica to help with hypervigilance. it gave us a life. would medication be an option for you?",
      "I really struggle with this too! I can't do anything relaxing, or fun, or just for the sake of it. I just can't seem to let go, and feel relieved. It makes me sad because I am not in the abusive situation now, and haven't been in general for around two years, so I know that realistically, there is no threat for me waiting round the corner. I find it upsetting as well because I am only 24, and all of my friends do things like have 'me days', where they sit about and do nothing, and have a nice relaxing bath, and pamper themselves, and I literally have three settings: 1. Hypervigilance-mode (I will do 'task-based' things obsessively like cleaning and organising files, laundry, helping other people sort out problems they have, because not doing something like this will mean that I have time to think) 2. Dissociative mode (totally absent, and can find myself in different places, like suddenly in the shops when the last thing I remember, I was at home), and 3. Asleep! I'm not kidding, if I try to do something that is inherently about me and my own enjoyment, I literally feel sedated and have to go to sleep, or have to stop doing it and do something task-based instead. I don't know how to stop it or minimize it, but it's making me so angry and pent-up!"

      "I think I’m experiencing emotional flashbacks. I did some research online and found this at a site about childhood PTSD: “Unlike specific memories of events, emotional flashbacks involve strong negative emotions. A person will be flooded, for small reasons or no reasons, with an overwhelming sense of sadness, rage, terror or frustration. It can happen when you wake up, for example, or when someone criticizes you, or gives you a present. You are not reliving some childhood experience consciously — you know that you are here in present time. But the emotions don’t know it and are reacting like you did during the original trauma.” I can relate to that so much. I often react very strongly to things that I really don’t think is in proportion to it - if someone’s tone or something they say reminds me the slightest of the abuse, I immediately feel an extreme anxiety, fear, sadness, guilt, and like I just want to rip myself apart, although I know that what just happened is in no way actually dangerous or anything, but it’s as if all the feelings from the past trauma is coming back all at once, and even though I am not reliving the traumatic event or am dissociating to the point where I’m all “checked out”, I feel like I’m reliving it emotionally. I also read that if the trauma occured before the age of 2 (I think?), before you’re able to make any actual memories, you can still have flashbacks but not in that reliving it as if it’s a movie playing in your head-flashback, you know? I’ve always thought that “no, I can’t have PTSD because I don’t have visual flashbacks where I feel like I’m re-living it as if it’s a movie or something (like flashbacks are mostly protayed in the media, at least from my experience)”, but maybe I can? I did suffer both neglect and emotional abuse as a child. Whenever something reminds me of it, like if I ask someone something and they reply as if they don’t really care, it can trigger me massively, and my mind is shouting “they don’t care”, over and over again, and I feel just like I did when I was a child and felt negletced and it makes me want to d*e. Is it possible to suffer from PTSD with only emotional flashbacks? And, what is PTSD apart from the flashbacks, if there is anything else? I don’t want to say that I’m experiencing flashbacks if that’s not the case, so I’m wondering what you think? In a way, I can’t really get my head around the idea that I might actually experience flashbacks because of past trauma - PTSD, flashbacks, trauma, “no way! That sounds so serious, I’m sure what I’ve been through can’t have been that bad”, is what I’m thinking. Also, I think I have some memory loss as well, from when I was a child. I know that the abuse started before I turned 12, but it was at the age of 12 that I “realised” what was going on. It’s as if another person was experiencing the abuse before that. I know that it hurt a lot, but I can’t feel it, can’t remember what it was like or any specific situations, it’s all just a big emotional pain. Almost like the emotional flashback thing - I’m not reliving an actual event, but rather the feelings of the neglect or abuse. Does this make any sense?",
      "Little wrote: And, what is PTSD apart from the flashbacks, if there is anything else? Not talking academically but from experience, my big ones were:- Nightmares, same person similar theme, very bad effect, would wake in fear sweating and then was so elevated sleep was very difficult. They gradually reduced but lasted decades. Like I said they would start different (always my abuser) but wind up the same Hypervigilance - Differs. for me it is waking very easily and being fully alert when I do. Always scanning streets, coffee shops, trains, everywhere. It is my normal Hyperarpousal - comes from a trigger. For me these days it is reading about or hearing about certain unusual items of extreme abuse similar to mine - or simply seeing a middle age brunette wearing horn rimmed glasses. Pulse elevates and hyper awareness goes into over drive as a survivor also have the classic big two:- Low self esteem and zero trust Self esteem will always be a work in progress and I like not trusting people - I never get let down so can't see that changing. If I had to put one above all others it was the repetitive night mare. in 20s maybe every month 30s maybe every 3 months 40s maybe 3 times a year 50s maybe 2 a year it still comes but no where near as bad"

      "as I mentioned last week I had a trigger and my HV and HA kicked in that night. First time in a really long time. The trigger had been something specific to my own case. Last night after my son came home late I noticed I could not hear him. The night of my event I heard everything. Every foot fall, every word spoken, every rattle of cups and dishes in the kitchen. Everything. It is not just a term but your senses are ramped up by maybe 25 -33%. To do that there is a cost. Just some thoughts.",
      "Definitely a cost.. Strange question maybe, but do you find that clothing and other things irritate you when you're hypervigilant? Like you've got so much else to try and process, that even some clothing can be too much sensory input? (i'm trying to figure out what's ptsd and what's aspergers )",
      "Sea, your situation is very unusual. I sometimes think there is a multiplier in your case that may not apply elsewhere. That said we don't really get a lot of info for CA -PTSD, it is usually in broad terms and specialists find it hard to differentiate between CA PTSD and PTSD from seeing adult trauma. My PTSD symptoms have been gradually reducing over the years. All of them reducing at the same rate. Apart from the assault / robbery at McDonalds 17 years ago, it had been a steady decline. My trigger was not seeing trauma but reading an account of what a child had experienced. There were three specific things that were the same as my case,  one I had not read before. I thought that mine was unique. Anyway that triggered it. The judge referred to it as torture not abuse and he was right. I found I was amped up. It was draining,  my home that night was quiet and my environment was calm, but my breathing was elevated, my pulse was up and my hearing was extraordinary. Gone the next day. As a child whenever I had hearing tested it was always very sharp. At my primary school when they came to me that had to turn the fridge off in the room as it interfered with a stop watch test. No other child had heard it. So I guess I was hyper alert from as young as I can remember. it was my normal.. so you don't know it is a problem",
      "I think that possibly C-ptsd exacerbates whatever sensitivities are already present in your underlying personality. I get fits of sensory input overload but I'm of the opinion that I'm also naturally ill-suited to receive sensory inputs as I'm spending a lot of time in my head.

      "In response to Seabreezeblue (Hi btw I am very new to the forum). Re: Some recent insights on Hyper Vigilance Hyper Arousal by seabreezeblue » Sun Aug 20, 2017 6:07 pm Definitely a cost.. Strange question maybe, but do you find that clothing and other things irritate you when you're hypervigilant? Like you've got so much else to try and process, that even some clothing can be too much sensory input? My clothes drive me bloody insane when I am experiencing my CPTSD and Severe Anxiety strongly. My body itches constantly, my clothes feel awkward and ill fitting to the point that I might change four or five times a day. Nothing ever feels clean or comfortable. It is SOOO annoying. It makes sense though as the skin is the largest sensory organ in the somatic nervous system and it is feeding straight into the relevant parts of the brain that are currently getting battered by PTSD. I can't distinguish sometimes if it is psychosomatic or just CPTSD / SA symptoms, I just try to ignore it as best I can. A",
      "Re the clothes, I think it is personal. In your case it may very well be PTSD or could it be something re triggering. Could the PTSD exacerbate a trigger ?? Warning: have lots of anecdotal evidence but zero professional quals. With me it is always hearing. I would lie awake until my abuser had fallen asleep, only then could I sleep, so I would listen very carefully. When I get triggered I get super hearing, quite freaky really, and it is specific, my hearing is searching for very faint sounds filtering out the noise. I honestly think the people with the real Quals are just scratching the surface on this stuff. And welcome, so it took me so long to drop around, been doing crazy work travel.",
      "I don’t usually post here but since I have been experiencing these issues it seems appropriate. I’ve also been staring at the ‘post a reply’ box for the best part of an hour trying to get my thoughts together so this may be a little jumbled. For me triggers associated with ptsd are always specific, there may be quite a convoluted connection, but there is always an element which connects back to a traumatic event. Given that psychological trauma is an event which completely overwhelms an individuals ability to cope and trauma disorders are fundamentally the psychological effects of being unable to integrate that experience I think this is consistent. That is as opposed to other psychiatric problems, most of which have correlations with abuse, but are not inherently trauma disorders. The nature of the hyper vigilant/hyper arousal is always extremely primal.  In the case of hyperarousal it’s always about perception of threat, like the ape who sees a glimpse of a predator and becomes alert to every small sound or movement. Hyper vigilance would be more akin to the wariness seen in wild animals. Things like social anxiety and paranoia are different in that they are often a far more ‘social’ reactions, the former often having to do with a sensation of inferiority about how you look or behave, and the later being characterised by heavily integrated persecutary delusions. The last aspect would be just how unintegrated the experience is in terms of cognition.  This morning by girlfriend trod on a dogs paw which caused it to squeal loudly which i upstairs heard as a scream.  Now the very first thought I had was that a dog had just got trodden on but it didn’t make a damn bit of difference to the emotional and sensory reaction which followed.  It’s now four and a half hours later and my senses are still on edge, that I now know for certain exactly what the problem was and have spent a couple of hours trying to use a variety of relaxation techniques has had little difference. I find that flashbacks work in the same way. I can stand there thinking that it isn’t happening again, know that it isn’t possible for it to be happening again but the waves of terror and despair run roughshod over cognitive control. It’s then a case of waiting for the reaction to subside and pull myself together again. I think much of the confusion, particularly that surrounding C-PTSD/EPCACE/DESNOS is because it rarely occurs alone and the situations which are required to create it are nasty enough to create other types of disorder. Equally there are many for whom it is a more sympathetic descriptor than say BPD and other for whom the label itself is satisfying. I agree to a that trauma often exacerbates innate psychological tendencies but it doesn’t necessarily follow that the result of that is a trauma disorder.",

For me,  i fit with some symptoms of BPD.. but i most closely resemble someone with AvPD now.  Yet the tests i took indicate no underlying personality disorder. I also wonder just how many people with a diagnosis of BPD (or other PDs), would better fit with c-PTSD.. and i feel that PDs really shouldn't be diagnosed in many cases if the person has a significant history of trauma (at least not until a heavy duty dose of therapy has been given anyway).

      "Hi everyone, I wanted to know if anyone has experience with this. So I have just started seeing a new psychiatrist who so far I seem to click with quite well. Just for context, I have PTSD/CPTSD, ADHD (inattentive),depression, anxiety, OCD, and am on on the autism spectrum. I have in the past tried a number of medications (have been on most of the SSRI's/SNRI's), a few different benzos, and a few antipsychotics. Currently I take 75mg venlafaxine, 15mg dexamphetamine (only when I'm studying or working), as needed clonazepam, and have just taken my first dose of lamotrigine. I am trying to mostly cut out the clonazepam and my psychiatrist suggested trying lamotrigine. Currently I take clonazepam about 2-3 times a week (0.5-1mg a dose) and I have done this for about 3-4 years now. Clonazepam really helps me personally, but I'm starting another university course and find that I don't like some of the cognitive effects that come with clonazepam for me (eg memory loss/it's harder to remember things/learn new things and I'm already not great with that haha.) Anyway, I'm just wondering if other people have taken lamotrigine for PTSD/CPTSD/anxiety spectrum things, and what your experience has been like? I know it's different for everyone but I am keen to hear other people's experiences. Thanks"

      "So I was the subject of some intense abuse in childhood. Mother was schizophrenic and she would have sex with strangers right in front of me. She would go to their houses and sleep with them completely oblivious that I even existed. There was also alocool abuse and drugs. She was also very violent in front of me. Like she once threw a rock into a doctors cabinets. She slapped a post office guy for not delivering some package she was expecting. Finally she completell lost it and tried to burn her mother's house then called her up and told her she was a prostitute. Does this sound like a recipe for cptsd?",
      "sounds like you've got all the right ingredients there.. what symptoms do you have?  how are your relationships/friendships? (if you have any oc..  some of us can't manage those until we've spent a lot of time healing) xx",
      "Haha yeah I guess so. I'm very paranoid and have serious trust issues. I can't trust anyone at the moment even my family. I think people are sharing private info on me. That my character is being assassinated. Because I keep hearing people talk about me saying things they are not supposed to know. Suspect my family is involved... i don't now anymore Don't really have a lot of friends but the few I hAve I distrust . Not sure what to do. To be honsst",
      "Sea is right about the ingredients. Sounds like classic child abuse issues. As children we are born with a sense of Fairness & a sense of Trust. it kept us from being eaten by Sabre Tooth tigers. It worked. When our childhoods go wrong we loose it. for many of us to a lesser degree what you describe is our norm. constant suspicion and always questioning. To some of us the idea of blind trust is silly. I think the self awareness you are displaying is a good sign. I think the big PTSD flags are Hyper Vigilance which tends to go hand in hand with Hyper Arousal and finally nightmares often with a recurrent theme.",
      "Thanks for your 2 cents. It's exactly as you two described. It's this insidious lack of trust and hypervigilance. Always on guard around people and can never really relax. Now the nightmares I'm not so sure about. Used to have a lot of them when I was younger. People turning into monsters and a magician/sorcerer laughing in my father's room (where he brought a hooker once and let his friends do the same).",
      "Do you get hyper arousal ?? You get  a trigger. It could be a phrase, smell, music, hearing a story and all of a sudden you have superman hearing and spider sense. You can now hear things that five minutes before you could not. Whether you have PTSD or not you have baggage to carry. Your childhood sounds ... unpleasant. I am not sure how you are but you sound bright and aware. With those tools you can get better and fit in fine. Don't let it get you down. Lots of us had crap childhoods, and some of us have done very well. Not easy, but it can happen.",
      "Yes Terry I do have hyperarousal most of the time and it's usually paranoid in nature. It's a pretty accurate description that you gave. Thanks for the advice. I am trying my best to work on myself and get better. It can be difficult at times but that's life Do you have cptsd?",
      "Hey man, all I can say is that you are most definitely not the only one. I had similar experiences. My dad was alcoholic and used to beat the $#%^ out of my mom infront of us kids. Mom left him one day, and he chased her down the street with my sister in one hand and a .357 in the other, apparently threatening to kill my sister.  Crazy stuff. But seek support, support groups seem to help me a lot. Makes me feel normal. I know you don't really trust them, and I don't either sometimes but there are days when I do, and life is worth living. Blessings to you.",
      "Scars welcome to the Abuse forums. We are rather quiet, most of the time. Thanks for your input, you sound like you are dealing with it .. well. How is your sister, do you see her much. Did your mum ever get out ..",
      "I feel weird responding about myself under someone elses post Terry, so I wrote a short blog updating my story, its called 3 years later if your interested."

      "So I haven't posted anything in 3 years.  its been ups and downs.  My life changes before my eyes, my emotions are extreme and there is nothing to hold on to. My father was an abusive alcoholic, he beat mom and was generally aggressive about a lot of things.  He put some deep fears in my psyche, and this is where my c-PTSD can be traced back to. I was also sexually abused at some point, but my memories are missing, feels like I've been robbed of them.  Can't remember much at all. I've been going to therapist, somatic experience, yoga, and support groups. I try to get all the help I can. Most of the time I don't trust these people, but every so often I do, if even for a minute, and then life is worth living at that moment. I want to hold on to that feeling, feel alive and that I want to live you know. But hanging on is actually worse. A few days ago I started dating someone, something I thought would never happen, so my view on this has done a 180 degree change in a matter of days.  Not sure what to believe, nothing is permanent and I feel I strive for permanence, security, safety.  But they don't seem to exist permanently, i'm just in a constant state of flux and movement. I feel like I'm holding on to a 2x4 in the middle of the pacific ocean, just wading waiting for the storm to pass and hope I don't drown. I don't have a question, just venting. Think its good for me. Expose it all."

      "Hey everyone, This is a bit complicated. I had been dealing with PTSD from a sexual assualt that happened about a year and a half ago. I had gotten support for that and at this time had been relatively okay (as much as someone can be). During this week however, a coworker has made a serious threat against my life and they have the means to go through with the threat (I found out this person is extremely unstable and has hallucinations and delusions about me). I have gone through all the channels involving police and the company I work for. I feel myself having symptoms all over again though. I am absolutely terrified. The person who has made the threat has been released and will be interviewed again at a later date to see if they can be held for longer, but the company I work for has recommended I go about business as usual under the assumption that I cannot be afraid to come to work. I am so scared though, and I keep imagining I will see them everywhere I go. I have taken the next week + off work, and I don't want to leave my house. I can't even imagine going back to the workspace I shared with them, especially given the chance they might show up. They don't even know if they can have this person fired because of how the company is set up. My whole body feels on high alert, I'm physically ill, my head won't stop hurting, I'm shaking and sweating and I keep seeing what will happen to me. I have no support for this either because I don't think anyone really understands what is happening with me and how it feels. I don't know what to do.",
      "Sometimes these triggering events can be worse than the first event. Don't know why, but it happens. Do you live alone, with family ? Have you been having counseling ?

I live with my family and they know about the incident, but they don't understand how I am feeling. I did go to counseling after the first assault and part of what she had mentioned (because I had that feeling that something awful was going to happen to me again) was letting go of the feeling that there is a threat out there and being hypervigilent. I think that may be what is making this so bad now, is because there is now a real threat out there. I think I need to go back now though because of all this but I have yet to make an appointment. I can't move within the company. I could quit, and I am wrestling with that option. As part of training I had applied to stay there in the same workspace to complete the training (which would be years). But I also applied to another company's training program across the country. It doesn't start for another 5 months so I would have to figure out what to do until then. The individual has not been fired. They aren't sure if they can fire him because of how everything is set up. They said I could get a protection order against him but it is literally a piece of paper and I would have to see him in order to get it. I don't really understand why the response by the company is so bad, given the seriousness of the threats.",
      "Not sure where you are but I thought they would be really worried about a stress/harassment claim and be all over it ?? Have you talked to anyone informally about legal options. and I would definitely look at counseling, this is going to be harder for them to say \"you don't  have anything really to worry about\"",
      "I think what happens with some organizations is that they are advised legally that they risk a lawsuit if they terminate someone that hasn't specifically broken the rules or the law.  You often find that people like your harasser walk right up to the line, but don't cross it unless provoked. I know it's really hard when you have PTSD, but you owe it to yourself to continue living your life in the face of this unwanted and unfair behavior.   But you can take some steps to protect yourself, that may remove some of the anxiety.  You can plan in advance, where you are going, and who's going to be with you, so you aren't alone.  You can ask for complete separation at work, they should be willing to do that and also enforce it.  If he is asked to stay away from you and he doesn't, that also gives them cause for termination. The protection order is worthwhile, but the court has to see evidence of a credible threat, and he has the right to present his side to avoid having the court restrict his movements.  He may or may not choose to do that, many times they do not show up and the process is made easier.  If all he has done is verbally threaten, not stalked you or got in your face, the court may or may not grant it. This is a really traumatic part of the law for survivors.  There is a presumption of innocence and a person like your harrasser can cause a lot of grief without triggering public action against him.  So I know it doesn't help much (small confort), but you have to understand that the seeming inaction is meant to protect people's rights.  The police often want to take action but it has to be legal.  They can talk to him and emphasize how close he is to serious trouble, and you can ask for that.  You can also keep the authorities and your workplace informed of his actions.  You can't demand action but you can set things up so that if he steps an inch over the line, there will be action. So I hope maybe some of these thoughts will help you.  Don't be afraid to express your concerns and make others aware of the problem.   But realize that the law determines what actions can be taken, and try not to blame others if they follow the law.  Just help them instead, by providing as much information as you can, and keeping them aware.  They know the guy is a creep and they do want to protect you, they're on your side.  So help them do that by working with them within the rules.  Don't let this idiot alter your relationship with the authorities, or with your employer.  You are in the right, he is in the wrong.  You know this and so does everyone else.",
      "Yeah the company has talked about trying to balance what they owe to him to try and help him get better (because he is really mentally unstable at this point- which makes it even scarier for me) and what they owe to the safety of the coworkers. The workspace isn't set up in a way that I would feel safe (the doors to the room I work in lock automatically and a select number of people have the code - including him - which means if I was yelling for help and someone across the hall heard- they wouldn't be able to even get in). Plus we don't have cellular or any phones in the workspace so I would have no way to call for emergency services. The only place to reach security is through a button which is located down the hall. I sit at a long desk with this guy (but we never talked much - just polite stuff). The threats he is making is with a gun, and he has one. When the police asked him about where it was, he made bizarre claims that he had thrown it away right before they got to his house (which is extremely bizarre considering he had no way of knowing they were coming, and who throws a gun away??). I am thinking my only option is to quit. I agree that they can't do much. It just sucks because I thought that there was more that could be done, and I'm worried that I've made myself more of a target by reaching out.",
      "Katie, I'm truly sorry it's that bad.   If you are locked in a room with him, I think you'd be well within your rights to ask for a panic button or intercom line, even one that you could carry with you, to summon help.  No company has the right to create an unsafe workspace, and I would raise the issue in those terms.  If he has threatened you by describing his gun, that's pretty clear, it's not ambiguous or subjective at all. I hate the idea of you being forced out, it's just wrong on all levels.   People like him should never win.  But I understand if you feel you have to look after your safety first. I once had the side of my car shot out with a shotgun, by a drunk guy who was sitting in his yard in a lawn chair taking pot-shots through the bushes.  He also had shot at his neighbor's houses, they removed buckshot from the siding, it matched the buckshot in my trunk.  He just missed my gas tank.  I called the police as my mother was an officer in that town.  They asked him to surrender his shotgun, he claimed that he didn't know where it was.  So they hauled him in but they couldn't hold him past 24 hours, there was no proof that he had fired the shot.  They did patrol constantly around his house for about a month, hoping to catch him with the gun (all they needed to arrest him).  Sometimes just parked out in front for hours at a time.  But at least he got the message, it never happened again. Idiots like this can completely ruin or overturn someone's life.  It isn't fair and it isn't right.  Again I'm sorry.  Please know you did nothing wrong.",

It would be reasonable to ask the company to review all of this. Even if not for your specific situation, these factors could have a number of negative impacts on safety in various scenarios. Think up a few scenarios where this set-up isn't safe and point out the company's liability if anything happens to any of the employees when it has been pointed out to them that this set up is dangerous. Usually, most places will be keen to improve workplace safety simply because if they were informed about the risk before an incident happens and then they don't do anything, they are likely to be sued. Not a massive comfort for you, but it could help motivate them to do something to improve the situation. I think avatar123's idea of a panic button is a reasonable one also.",
      "I just feel like I'm on a downward spiral. Everything just feels like it's getting worse and worse. Was in contact with the police today and they couldn't hold him because he acted like everything was okay. My supervisor at work told a friend/coworker that he has decided we take the approach of supporting him and acting extra there to make him feel less isolated. Meanwhile I just can't even seem to get out of bed. I'm so depressed and I'm having breakdowns. I can't stop thinking about everything, and how scared I am. I did make an appointment with my doctor though."

      "Hello. My name is Dawid *mod edit*  and i'm from Poland. I'm 20 years old and first i would like to apolagise. I am starting to learn english and there is possibility that i will make grammar mistakes. I wrote on Polish psychologist forum, but they were not able to help me. I had psychotic episodes because of my mother and father. They are both narcissistic. My father is also alcohol addicted. I was forced to move to psychiatric hospital, because i had psychotic episode and i've destroyed half of my room. And i was diagnosed with \"schizophrenia undifferentiated\". After 4 weeks of staying in hospital. I've noticed that i have every symptom of CPTSD. Every, without an exeption. My life was horrible. At least 7 years i was being bullied not only by my class in school, but other classes in Polish school too. I've tried asking help for teachers and other school staff but help from them was little if not none. Once i was brutally beaten by other class in middle school. I also got beaten by my father when i was in London. Twice. When i was 18... At day of my birthday i moved myself from Poland to London to my father. I was naive, because he told me that he will help me. I was in London for at least 14 months. I am making my own game production and i am learning how to do programming. I want to study neuroinformatics. But i have terrible CPTSD symptoms. It's hard for me to get help here in Poland, because they are diagnosing me with schizophrenia. They are giving me antipsychotic drugs which are not helping me at all. They are doing somthing to me that i can't even focus on my work. (as i said before, i am programmer) On Polish forums i am unable to find any useful informations about CPTSD. But after viewing English sites i've noticed, that i have everything from CPTSD. My question is: Is it possible to get professional help somewhere else in Europe? I am planning to move alone to Northern Ireland. I can't stand being diagnosed all the time with \"schizophrenia\". If you need any details about my life, feel free to ask."

      "Evening all (it's evening here in London). I am new to the forum so I will give a brief background to explain what has caused my CPTSD and SA. I suffered incest and childhood abuse from the age of 6 months old until about 14 from my father and maternal Grandfather. The abuse was physical, emotional and psychological as well as experiencing a wide degree of neglect. I am now 38 (in a few weeks). I have struggled with CPTSD and SA since a child. My unfortunate coping mechanism (which it clearly isn't) over the years off and on has been alcohol. I drank myself into a full stroke five years ago. I recovered. I retrained as a Personal Trainer with numerous other qualifications in Fitness (including an Exercise Referral Diploma - to treat others with anxiety / MH conditions through physical therapy and nutrition). I made the incredibly difficult and stressful decision three years ago to start a prosecution against my parents. It is complicated by the fact that my parents live in Northern Ireland and the prosecution is coming from a third country. (Republic of Ireland). It is taking a very long time. I am relieved that it is being taken seriously but as you can imagine it is a constant head fu$k for me to have this in the background. As this is a live investigation / prosecution the advice I have been given is NOT to undergo psychotherapy or counselling whilst this is ongoing - quite frankly that is no longer an option and I'll explain why. As a cheery aside I have also experienced somewhere between 7 and 10 adult rapes. Some from partners, some from lovers and some from strangers. I know that others have complicated sources of stress and I appreciate it, but my PTSD comes from more than one time / country / source so it can be horrifically overwhelming. Last year I had a drinking relapse, I decided to get my $#%^ together and I got a fabulous job (in Addictions and Public Health - the irony is not lost on me). I qualified as a SMART facilitator (a mutual aid support group for those with addictions). I passed probation at work, I had 10 months sober and I started an MSC in the Psychological and Neuroscience Foundations in Mental Health which I just missed a distinction in by 1%. I started to hit the throttle at 110 miles an hour to ignore the symptoms of my mental ill-health. I had a routine that started at 4am and ended at 10pm with no breaks six days a week. Study, training, work, study, dogs, volunteering etc - you get the picture. I got VERY ill with my CPTSD and SA at the end of the Christmas period (I have been estranged from my family for 20 years - NO contact so the only support I have is my partner). I had asked for an update on the case from the police in Ireland and it just was the straw that broke the camel's back. I thought the only solution was to drink it away (why do I always think that it will work). So as you can imagine that led one week later to a two week drinking binge which left me in hospital being told that I was at severe risk of brain damage due to the long period of sobriety. (I didn't take this in at the time, my partner had to tell me when I was more coherent and less at risk of a drinking relapse). I still have my job by some unknown fecking miracle. I have also scrabbled myself together enough to defer the first round of exams so that I can complete this module of my MSC and so that I don't lose the £2000 cost of the module. I have been signed off work for another 10 days which gives me a window to study so that I can complete this module and not lose a year to complete the MSC (this way I will get it in 2 years rather than 3). I guess I just needed to get it off my chest. I am experiencing hideous anxiety EVERY ruddy day. Itching, vomiting, panic attacks, manic bouts of energy followed by insurmountable lethargy. The PTSD has gone bananas as well - visual and auditory illusions, sensory overload, losing track of what I'm doing. I just took my dogs out for a walk and had a panic attack the whole time. Something I could do fine for the last five days. I just don't understand it and it's driving me fecking bananas (well more bonkers if that's possible). I just wanted to get all of that off my chest as I think that I am making my poor long suffering fiancé feel nuts as well. He is my only family (aside from my dogs) and I know I need to give him his space but my need is SOOO overwhelming right now. I just wanted to remind myself that I am not alone, that lots of other people are fighting through this $#%^ right now as well. I also feel a little calmer now that I've written all that novella down and I have to acknowledge even if only to myself all the things I have accomplished DESPITE and not because of what has happened to me. I guess my thought for the day is that we are not the product of what has been done to us we are the products of strength, humility, compassion and love that we show to ourselves when we can. Thanks for reading. If you have ANY tips for coping with the symptoms and still managing to be productive feel free to share them. Lots of warmth and compassion for others if not for myself right now. Amber",
      "Wow, read it all. Yep rants, downloads and monologues are always welcome. No sure if you can see this but I found your story inspiring. Huge congrats for tackling it head on, I will keep my fingers crossed that you can avoid triggers that will lead back to alcohol, and I really hope you nail the exams. I have been here for 5 years in August, and come from a background of extreme physical abuse. There are similarities but some major differences. I can tell you that I have two friends, one of them one of the most amazing, successful people anyone could want to meet, that has a lot of similarities with yours. I really admire you for pointing the Police to your parents. People like you are changing the world and making it a better safer place for others that will follow. I will now step away and let you go after that \"Distinction\" you deserve. Good luck, nice to have met you.",
      "Hi there Terry E, Thank you for the warm welcome to the group  / forum / site. Where your PTSD comes from is irrelevant when it comes to symptomology and illness. Though we differ in causes and individual symptoms we all share the same arse hole of an illness. I read your post this morning mid trying to drag my arse back upstairs to get on with the studying after a manic bout of cleaning, sorting and organising right through the night. My long suffering partner was grumpy AF this morning, but part of me caring for him when I am ill is to refuse to take anything he says or any tone of voice personally, he is simply wrung out. (Though it can be hard to take when you're sleep deprived and thread bare. Going to the police is one the things in my life I regret the most simply for what it has cost me personally and emotionally but also one of the things that I am most proud of. I had to do it for my own sanity, dignity, sense of self and sense of worth. It is tortuous though and not something that 95% of the world that knows me has a fecking clue about. I look forward to getting to know you and others better over the coming weeks / months / years but for now the ruddy books are calling (at least not literally). Three weeks sober tomorrow, that is always the turning point for some unknown reason so YEAH ME. Baby steps to WORLD DOMINATION eh! Hope you're having a good or at least stress free day. Warm wishes, Amber",

      "so for a little background... I am diagnosed BPD with narcissistic overlap (surprise, surprise) They (my friend) doesn’t know that *I* have narc. tendencies. They know that I have bpd, but I certainly don’t think they care enough to research bpd or the comorbidity with narcissism. Now I tread very lightly with this friend. I watch myself around them so as not to be controlling, but i’m having a hard time watching them be abused by THEIR covert narc partner! We have had multiple conversations about their partner…. the little things they say and do, which I have confirmed as being narcissistic abuse. I even told my friend that they sounded like a covert narc.. to which they politely went around what I said, as usual. During the last big blowup, my friend admitted some very real, raw things to me. They said that they felt like it wouldn’t work out in the beginning, that it wasn’t a good idea, they recognized the love bombing, that they knew they were being really shaken up and confused. Then…. somehow covert partner managed to patch things up overnight and then “everything was ok.” Covert narc has now also suggested planned hangouts.. where they agree to hang out together 24 hours in advance. They have already gone back on this agreement & my friend gently reminded them of this. But because I know covert tactics, this to me just screams CONTROLLED INTIMACY. Covert narc distances when she feels overwhelmed, and it’s under the guise of “healthy intimacy” since both covert & my friend identify as codependent. So again… my friend doesn’t sense anything wrong. “This is a good thing” they tell me. And I just want to scream at the top of my lungs “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAS YOU IN THE PALM OF HER HAND.” But my friend is a cancer & has a pattern of putting partners’ on pedestals so right now they just can’t see through the fog. I also think that they are suffering from stockholm syndrome. I’m so frustrated watching this. I suppose it's my own underlying need for control and I just want to SAVE them and open their eyes to the obvious. I've let it go for now as in we don't talk about it, but I hate having to fake like i'm entertained by their relationship when they speak about funny/cool things they've done together. I'm NOT AMUSED and want to stop pretending but don't want to crush my friend's already fragile ego. What would you do?",
      "If they purposefully ignore you multiple times when you've tried to open their eyes to whats going on then I just say let them sink. If they wont listen then they deserve what they get coming to them. That's just my opinion.",
      "CelestialFlame wrote: If they purposefully ignore you multiple times when you've tried to open their eyes to whats going on then I just say let them sink. If they wont listen then they deserve what they get coming to them. That's just my opinion. *sigh* I think you're right. we all have to learn somehow, huh? Just wish that they would trust their intuition... I know it's muddled when you've been abused repeatedly, though.",
      "If they haven't listened to you after multiple times then they probably wont listen to you ever. They're digging their own hole here. Its good that you care about their wellbeing but some people just cannot be helped, especially if they do not want it.",
      "This friend wouldn’t happen to be your fp would it?",
      "Quoth wrote: This friend wouldn’t happen to be your fp would it? No, thank GOD. I haven't imprinted on anyone as of late lol! They are just someone that I have a lot in common with and I think because we mirror so much, I want to save them like I want to save myself but I haven't actually touched the subject with them since. Haven't brought it up at all because I do realize we are two very separate people living different truths. I have to let them be as they are, in the same way that I would expect my friends to do. We hear what we want to hear and leave the rest. Focusing on my own life, as suggested by ya'll and also my therapist (lol), is the best option. When the tower falls, I don't want to be in the danger zone.",
      "Hi, I can relate to this, although it is just an online acquaintance who I'm reading their trauma diary elsewhere online and they have been with someone who's about 20 years older than them for 16 months now. My acquaintance has only been 'allowed' to her partner's house one time yet her partner has a spare set of keys to her house and is round hers regularly. Her partner wont stay overnight with her unless they are notin the city they both live in. Because of that they have only stayed the night together a handful of times.. the partner just goes to their own home after they've had sex at like 1am. Her partner also accuses her of cheating or wanting to cheat even though she's not. Now her partner has proposed to her just one month after her grandmother passed away and she is grieving so badly and it's going to take years likely because her gran was her best friend in the whole world and she died unexpectedly before Christmas. She said she will marry this partner and now they both have rings. I had to step back and I no longer talk to her but I still read along in her trauma diary and I am just leaving her to her own devices now because its so obvious she has been love bombed and cant see through it. It's not worth wasting my energy on and I hope you wont get too stressed over your friend's situation either. There's nothing I can see that I can do after I already warned her in the nicest possible way in October. I was in an abusive relationship for 13 years and I didn't realise it until a few years ago. If I'd left any sooner than what I did it's more likely I would've gone back but now theres NO way I would go near my ex again. So yes, we have to learn for ourselves the hard way I think, unfortunately"

      "Hello. I have a friend who has PTSD. Yesterday he had a bad PTSD episode for the first time (mainly reliving his trauma).His wife didn't know what to do at the time and since I've been with people who have PTSD in the past I was able to help her through it. The issue now is he doesn't remember it and he's confused about certian things we're doing (either cause we don't want to trigger it again or because he asked us not to after the attack last night). I told his wife last night he might not remember it and not to tell him in case it brings back memories. My question is, is that last part a good thing? Or would it be ok if I let him know he had a PTSD attack? I won't go into detail of course, I just want to know if I can tell him what happened (please note he prone to mini strokes often brought on by anxiety attacks)",
      "As long as he knows he has PTSD, and you tell him carefully,  then i don't see any reason why he shouldn't be told. He clearly knows something is going on, and it's usually better to be open with people with PTSD, because keeping things from them can trigger a lot of issues with paranoia (the hypervigilance causes the mind to work overtime when it's trying to figure out anything that confuses the person).",

Thanks. I got some helpful information from someone I know who studies psychology and they gave me the same response and I did end up talking to the person.",
      "awesome (: how did it go when you spoke to him..  he's okay?",
      "seabreezeblue wrote: awesome (: how did it go when you spoke to him..  he's okay? Sorry about the late reply. It went well. It took me and his fiance a bit to get him to understand it wasn't something he had to apologize for, but he's doing better now!"

      "I haven't gotten an actual PTSD dx yet that I know of...... I just have comorbidities liste, GAD, etc.. My reality is I stay with family out of desperation for housing. They do a food \"look good\" from the outside. But there is insideous bullying, covert mental games, and lots of denial and shaming with well-placed words in conversations. I have left very hurt many times. I have to be here again for a while. I am trying to tell myself they have a problem that isn't allowed to be acknowledged. But I can still get into intense anxiety and hypervigilent feelings and on certain occasions literally feel like a horse kicked me in the stomach.  I need a safe place where men will not demand sex for rent to go that is not a shelter. I have dearly suffered in those too. I am betweem a rok and a hard place and /i could use help with triggers. Maybe I will try to find out if I can get counseling. It is just painful to do this over and over movin in and out in a cyclic fashion. I applied for SSDI for a second time this past month. I will walk on egg shells in some ways until I get back out.",
      "I'm sorry to hear you are in that situation. That is so difficult. It is good that you are keeping trying to help yourself out of this predicament. It is a massive downfall of society that people are forced to rely on abusive family members due to financial constraints, it shouldn't be that way. It is worth you looking into if you can get therapy. Therapists can be able to provide some support in some instances to help you with documents you might need to get social support for housing or can refer you to other support systems. It might depend on where you are as to how systems of support work. At the very least you can talk through your worries with a therapist and it can help you feel you have more internal strength to change things and find a better situation for yourself.",
      "I have 12 step like and other groups that I share things in common with. It's like the \"chosen family\" I spent my Christmas with my chosen family at a potluck too. My insurance just got set back up correctly. I will ask for more counseling soon. I have a lot on my plate, it doesn't help when I have chronic pain issues and I just filed for SSI/SSDI for a second time."

      "I'm talking to this guy with PTSD.  He's always on edge.  One day he says to go away.  The next moment he says let's hang out.  Then he says lets sext.  He's obviously confused.  Idk if its his ptsd.  He gets upset easily as well.  It's emotionally exhausting.  I like him and want to be with him.  I just need a break.  I texted him \"Im giving you your space bc I know you need it.  Im here for you and i hope you feel better.\"  How much space is enough?  Is a month too long? or right?",
      "Is his PTSD incident based. Or from ongoing trauma. I was attacked in a robbery and it took a few months, maybe 6 before I was close to normal. I am also a child abuse survivor and the triggers from that are still with me and probably always will be although no one can see then any more as I am aware of what happens.",
      "It's great you are trying to be considerate of his needs. It's difficult because everyone has different needs for space. People do not all heal at a certain rate and come to terms with what has happened. Some people might struggle to recover at all. Have you spoken to him about the weird signals he's giving you? It may help him if he can become aware of what is going on for him internally and he might not have realised the opposing actions without having it pointed out...",
      "Just be mindful that no matter what the disorder, there's always a personality to think about as well. If he didn't have PTSD, would you be okay with sexting and hanging out rather than a proper relationship? Some push-pull is completely normal for some people with PTSD, but don't forget to think about your own needs and place them at the same level you're placing the guys needs. I'd happily deal with the pull-push of ''let's go out''.. and ''i need some space so i can process and decompress''..  but i'd see the ''go away, come back and sext'' as a sign that he's only after something short term and not serious."

      "After repeated emotional traumas, many things I used to enjoy, no longer make me happy. In fact I have a weird depressive reaction to things I used to love. My trauma seems to get activated, sometimes quickly sometimes slowly in relation to this. I've been to therapy but it seems to relapse. How do I process my feels and get my joy back?",
      "What types of therapy have you tried so far? Ultimately, losing the joy for things you once enjoyed indicates some area of trauma that you are yet to process. Sometimes different therapies don't work for different people and you might need to try a different type in order to see if you can better target the things that you need to process."

      "I recently realized that I no longer like being touched at all and I would like to understand why or how to fix it. I am 42 years old, have two children who are now adults and I have never been this way until recently. I've always been very affectionate, very needy and I was that way when I entered my current relationship. However, I went through a very difficult time in this relationship where he had an affair on me for 3 years (so many lies, so many ridiculous scenarios that I couldn't even begin to describe in a post and I should never have put myself thru) and although I fought through the affair and it's been 4 years now where he has been 100% loyal (yes I'm sure)  but, it was very emotionally traumatic experience for me, and although I seem to be on the mend from it, I'm wondering what damage it has caused me. I noticed the more affectionate he gets the more I push away. The things that I used to beg him for (holding hands, rubbing my back, cuddling, etc) actually annoy me now. Not to mention sex has been completely off the books and I don't even have a desire (some of that could be medication/hormonal related as well) but I am taking hormone supplements. But I hate that I could be just fine and when he touches me I just get annoyed and I don't want to say anything because I don't want him to feel like i'm rejecting him. I do want to add that I was sexually abused on two occasions by my dad, but that was when I was very young and don't feel that has anything to do with this current issue but in case it could have some bearing on what I'm going through, I though I would mention it. I thought it was just his touch, but I only recently realized that it wasn't just him, my boss (female) came up and touched my shoulders and it startled me, at first I didn't think anything of it other than she just startled me but she is a very affectionate person and I noticed over the past two years working with her she that I tend to flinch and then I started paying attention to when others touch me just like on the shoulder or to get my attention or just skin to skin, I flinch or move away and I have always been the one to touch others. I don't mind hugs, when I see a friend or if I'm hugging my daughter good night (my daughters touch doesn't bother me but I am aware of it when we touch) as long as it's quick I don't have any reservations about it, but now that my boyfriend has become more affectionate I feel like I'm going to snap and I know he's just trying to please me but I don't know how to handle it without seeming like I don't love him. I do love him (I think) and the thought of losing him scares me, but I don't want to be touched. Anyone have this experience or know what process I could pursue into recovering from it. I don't like it and I don't want to be so detached and so cold. I have no desire for affection or attention, most of the time I just prefer to be left alone. I don't want to feel like that, is it mental or medical? I do have hashimoto's thyroiditis so I do know that autoimmune disorders can reek havoc in lots of ways but I just feel like this might be more associated with the trauma that went with the affair. It was horrible and do not wish it on my worst enemy. I don't know what to do! Any advice or recommendations would be much appreciated. Thank you.",
      "A warm welcome from Psychforums, ALARAVYPER! Lots of thoughts go through my head when you share your story.  My main thought is \"Are you still upset (angry) at him for cheating and putting you through all that?\" I always recommend others to seek help from a therapist.  As I recommend to you. There was a time in my life when a person touched me inappropriately and I was beyond shocked and there was all there was to it, but ever since then, expecially at that time, I was very sensitive and didn't want anyone to touch me because I questioned their motives, especially men.  One woman, a dorm manager for the college would touch my shoulder and I didn't like her and I didn't want her to dare touch me like we were friends.  \"Stay away.\"  These are way I can relate to not wanting others to touch me.",
      "ALARAVYPER wrote: but I don't want to be touched. Anyone have this experience or know what process I could pursue into recovering from it. I don't like it and I don't want to be so detached and so cold. Right .... so you think that is not normal. Wow it is for me. Only person who I ever did not mind touching me was my first love and my wife. anything else, my sons, mother, brother extended family, even hand shakes, now that you mention it are something I would prefer to avoid. The big issue for you is your partner. I would go with the therapist, as there may be lots more there than you think. Yep, I seldom say therapy, but think it could be a real benefit here.",
      "Thank you to both of you for your responses, I think therapy is going to definitely be a must. I don't know if I am still angry at him for everything or not, but what's weird is this is such a sudden thing like it has only been in the past maybe year or less (that I noticed it) being an issue, before that I was probably the most lovable and affection person. I think I have just become so protective of myself that I've built this wall around me and just won't let anyone in. Now that I am aware of it I think it's even worse because it's become annoying and I'm sooo afraid of hurting his feelings. I shouldn't and maybe I am still angry because I still feel he doesn't have a right to get mad if I still am dealing with the effects of everything he put me through but I still want to get past it. Was hoping someone else would've had this similar experience and could shed light on it, I haven't been able to find any information out on it, I mean is it like a C-PTSD response or is it a detachment issue, I just feel like the sooner I can find out the better off I'll be but I guess now to find a therapist lol",

      "Does anyone here experience or have thoughts on C-PTSD, and how you cope with or take it apart in day to day life? For several years in adolescence I lived in an incredibly unpredictable family environment; I lived in fear and a high stress mode to deal with consistent verbal, emotional, and occasional physical abuse. Although it eventually smoothed out, that period of time is still deeply ingrained in me many years later. I'm hypervigilant, repeating maladaptive coping mechanisms from the past, on edge, anxious, guilt ridden, and often break down completely in conflict or situations that trigger the same emotional states from childhood. I have diagnosed BPD traits and I know BPD is sometimes debated as just a type of C-PTSD in some cases. It's too complicated to really take apart on the spot, but I'm wondering if any of you have experiences with this, how to cope with it?",
      "I have c-ptsd with strong dissociation and OCD tendencies. I was pretty quickly given a dx of schizoid pd, (I think all pd's will have a likely chance of ptsd of some kind), and a mood disorder. I use maladaptive coping mechanisms a lot. They aren't harmful, but do eat up my day. I go to a CBT psychologist once a week, and we're planning on me seeing a psychiatrist for me to get meds for my bipolar I. Therapy seems to have helped me a lot.",
      "I was diagnosed with BPD but my therapist believes I have CPTSD. I was sexually assaulted on a daily basis when I was young by a neighbor. I've just become open about my trauma within the past year. I do relate to the symptoms of CPTSD more than BPD, even though now I don't have as severe regular PTSD symptoms these days."

He has told me that he struggles to feel love for me (although previously in our 6 yr relationship he used to love me and always express this).

He tells me he is a \"damaged\" person and its not fair to me... someone give me some insight please?",

      "Excuse my english, please, I´m not native. I used to spend a lot of time with my grandmother (my dad´s mother) – my only grandparent still alive. She was nice at first, she even played with me in the beginning, but also spent days talking about her unhappy and bad life. She told me about various of our or just mine relatives, what they are doing wrong, how they are mean to her, how they are bad. She even told me about my mum, about everything she has done wrong, how she is mean to her, to me, how bad mother she is. She even taught me sentences to say, like „I will tame my mum when I am older“ etc. She told me bad things about mum till my teenage years. When I defended mum, she always found something bad to say about her, some concrete example. But granny always distorted things. My mum isn´t perfect and she certainly has done some things wrong, but for me, she has been the most important person, someone who has always helped me, someone who has always been here for me. But no, after my grandma´s words, I thought that she maybe is bad, that maybe she is bad mother, but my heart told me the opposite. I just didn´t know what to think about it, I felt bad because I loved being in my mum´s company the most. My grandma also couldn´t stand me missing my mum and was always so mad at me when I did. She came to me when I was crying and told me to shut up, that I won´t have mommy, that she is sick of me (granny). Granny wanted me to help her and then she was telling me how clumsy I am and laughed in my face, even when my friends were around. But she was always talking badly about my friends (especially the ones with handicaps or from different countries – she is very racist) and never wanted me to spend more time with them than with her. She was saying that she will die soon so I should be with her instead of them. I could never really plan my holidays, especially summer holidays, I had to spend almost whole 2 months at our \"cottage\". Our \"cottage\" is a big old house where my grand uncle (her brother) lives. It´s very dirty there, he has never cleaned up and even when we cleaned the whole house over and over, it never helped. Grand uncle (I called him Grandpa) was nice to me, he liked children. He was an alcoholic, always arguing with someone, and abusing our dog. When he got older, he started to shout in the middle of the night that we ruined his life, that he wants us to die and started wetting himself, so there were yellow spills all around the house. He wasn´t the only one arguing there, granny provoked grandfather, dad was mad at granny because of that, there was bad tension and conflictss between my mum and granny, and between my half-sister and granny. Mum even stopped spending time there. I felt sad and homesick there, I never befriended children there (except one way younger little girl), some of them were mean and violent. I wanted to leave, but I couldn´t, because it was summer holidays, and \"summer holidays are supposed to be spent at cottage.\" Mummy had no idea how I felt there otherwise she would help me. Granny used to have two children - my father and a little girl, who accidently died in thirteen. She never recovered from it. She used to dress me in her dresses, give me her toys and call me her name. Granny is very negative person, she always found something negative on everyone, even on people she never met. Granny used to mock me, she hasn´t stop laughed, even when I begged her to stop, she was laughing more and more. Granny wanted me to spend a lot of time with her, but I felt very sad and lost in her presence. My dad is another chapter. He suffered from depression long before I was born and for whole my childhood and a few of my teen years. He was very overprotective parent, always afraid that something will happen to me, so much that I was very stressed and afraid to do almost anything. But he was also rush sometimes and one accident happened. It was summer, I was six and he took me on a ride on his bike. I was sitting on a bike tube, he suddenly braked but with both handles at once. I flied across handlebar grips and fell on my head. I was unconscious for some time, then spent week or two in hospital at intensive care unit and then few more weeks in bed at home. Since this accident, I suffer from strong headaches and have neurological problems similar to epilepsy. Dad and mum argued a lot, dad always pointed out some of mum´s \"mistakes\" and after a few years, he couldn´t even look to her when sitting near, he rather covered his face to not to see her. Daddy yelled at me, too. When he helped me prepare to school, he was always so mad at me for how clumsy and slow I am (I also suffer from ADD, so I have a huge problem with concentration), how I am doing it wrong. I don´t remember exactly what he used to say, but I know I was always feeling so bad and even when I remember it now, I´m shivering. I just remember he told me that I am a brat and useless. He placed such demands on me and was so criticizing that I started to hate myself for being so clumsy and imperfect. I was so scare of him, always taking care not to make him mad. I rather spent time with mummy and he noticed. He told me angrily that I don´t like him that much as mum. I didn´t want him to know because it would hurt him, so I stopped being with mum so often, and stopped talking about her. School is another chapter. I couldn´t wait to go to the kindergarten, but it was a shock for me. I was always a bit shy and missed my mum a lot, but it was worst when I was in there. I was born with dyspraxia - motor coordination disorder - so I was way slower than the other kids and quite clumsy, and my movements were unusual and funny sometimes. I couldn´t hold flatware properly, I couldn´t cut with scissors, I couldn´t tie my shoelaces properly, etc. Not just children were mean to me because of it, but one of the two teachers too. She told me how clumsy I am, she was very mad at me. I don´t remember much of it, only that I hated it there and wanted to leave. I always cried when mum or dad were leaving me there. When I came to school, it wasn´t much better. Children continued bullying me, making fun of me. Even teachers were mean to me. Four of them (including the one in the kindergarten) bullied me, especially in classes where it was clear that I am so clumsy (no one cared about my dyspraxia, even thought I had a paper from doctor). But first and second grade was fine, just few kids and only one teacher bullying me. But had to change school at third grade because village school was getting too easy for me, we didn’t learn the things we were supposed to there. And then it all started. Almost no one befriended me, so many people made fun of me. With situation at home I just couldn´t stand it anymore. I stopped being happy and creative kid, I couldn´t even enjoy things I loved, I haven´t slept for hours, I puked in the mornings before school. I also seemed stupid because we haven´t learned much in village school, we missed a lot of things and teacher in the third grade didn´t believe me that we didn´t learn it there, and told me I just forgot it. I stopped being the clever one and even became the stupid one. I believed them. I believed them that I am stupid. I thought I am completely useless. I thought I can do nothing. My classmates made fun of me, told me how weird I am, how I´m not even person, that I´m UFO. In 7th grade, there was one girl bullying me. Nothing special, but this one was my best friend at first. Then she started making fun of me, she told me that I am the ugliest in whole class (thx to my psychical state, I wasn´t quiet pretty, I looked tired and pale as death, I admit that), how I don´t have anyone but her and my mum, how I cannot do anything. When I told her I will stop being friends with her for what she is saying to me, she told that I could never, that I am too weak for that. Because I wouldn´t have anyone, because everyone else hates me. I just didn´t know what to do. I just couldn´t anymore. I sat in the window and thought about jumping. I wanted to hurt myself so I hit myself in my head with my fist or with book or against the wall. When I went to high school, everything was different. No one bullied me, I even found many friends. But I still felt so bad. I cared so much about what I eat, I ate so little for long time that I wasn´t far from anorexia. I don´t want to blame my granny for everything, but she hated fat people and when I started putting on weight in puberty, she made fun of me. But I was still skinny back then. It was just unacceptable not being ultra skinny in my family. In seventeen I was diagnosed with depression. With that, I almost isolated myself from granny and until now (I´m 21) see her very rarely. My dad was diagnosed with depression few years before me, and now we have a really good relationship. I feel so much better these days, doing hobbies I like and am good at (my dyspraxia is almost gone, so I am finally good at art, crafting and photography), studying the university I love (special pedagogy- helping handicapped people) and I´m surrounded by people I love being with. But still there are times when my depression comes back. I feel so bad I want to yell, kick the walls, I don´t know how I feel. I don´t know if I´m not just overreacting. I just wish I could delete my past. I still have a nightmares where all my childhood fears go back, like I´m living them again. I don´t know to fight them, nothing is helping me."

      "Hey guys, I'm posting this because I'm curious how many people out there have the same issues... Background: I have been diagnosed with PTSD based off of an assortment of back to back traumatic events in my life. I have a complicated history of one bad thing after another and most of the time things weren't related. For a time I guess you could say I was incredibly unlucky in life. If people ever hear my history (I mostly don't talk about any of it) they are sometimes baffled. Now onto the dream part... I dream EVERY single night, and I cannot remember the last time that I had a good dream. My dreams fluctuate between nightmares and simply \"bad\" dreams. When it comes to nightmares, some are reoccurring, but most are variations of dreams with a common theme. Some are like flashback of events in my life, but many have randomly added parts. Sometimes I can remember every little detail, but quite often I forget most of it just moments after I wake up, like the memory is getting carried on the wind and I can't catch it. The harder I try to remember, the faster it disintegrates. But MOST of the time, I just have \"bad\" dreams. They almost always involve violence, or at least things that are highly unpleasant. For some people, these dreams might be considered nightmares, but I guess I've desensitized to the point where they are just there. Don't get me wrong, the bad dreams still bother me emotionally, but I've developed a sort of resignation to them. And like the nightmares, I can't always remember everything. At times I am actually curious and want to go back to sleep to try to learn more or make better sense of them. Perhaps I haven't done enough research, but I haven't really found anything that sounds like this when I look up PTSD. Is this a weird situation? Is it strange and/or unhealthy behavior for me to want to go back into a bad dream? Is there anyone out there who has experienced the same thing? I have so many questions but I'll leave it there for now. Thanks, -Breezewriter",
      "I have nightmares ALL THE TIME. lAST NIGHT FOR EXAMPLE.  I had a dream that my partner and I were walking around a city and both were kidnapped and brought to this warehouse.  Our kidnappers were all native and held us in cages along with many others that were kidnapped before us. At one point my partner and I were taken out of our cages and took to another part of the warehouse. I was demanded to give my kidnapper a blow Job and my partner had to watch. My partner got violent and started to stab our kidnapper. So before I had to do anything sexually my partner saved me and I woke up. LOL, my dreams are the worse. Its been only the past few years I remember all my dreams. They are mostly negative or surrounded with bad things. I don't have many pleasant dreams, hum, weird. There is always danger drama or something sinister about my dreams, I can't even get away from negativity in my sleep haha ! I have recurring dreams often, not always nightmares however same dream, same people and same emotions upon waking up.",
      "There is research to suggest that dreams are bad or good depending on which centers of the brain are involved in dreaming.  One purpose of REM sleep is to prepare various brain areas for new processing of information.     So areas that are active during the day are likely to be involved in REM dreams at night. This means if you are processing negative thoughts during the day, your dreams will likely reflect them.  So one thing you can do is try to find balance, spend some tine each day doing things you enjoy, or considering the good in life.  People with PTSD have a hard time not dwelling on the negative, their brains are somewhat conditioned to do so by exposure to trauma.  But to the extent that you can, it will help, both during the day and while dreaming at night. If you can put your focus on enjoyment, that can help a lot.  If you sense yourself ramping up for conflict or getting stressed about something, try to set it aside by giving yourself a pleasant distraction.  Not easy to break out of that cycle, I know, but you can remind yourself it's the healthier alternative to getting stressed or dwelling on the negative. Again it's not easy or simple to do this, but any progress you can make will be beneficial."

      "I was sexually abused by my uncle for years as a child.  It ended when I was 8.... He was caught red-handed. I was too innocent to understand the wrongness of it then and missed him at a level.  But I had reflexively mentally blocked all memories of the abuse for years till I realized one evening as a teen what he had really done.  Then for years I kept denying the reality of it till I could deny it no more. I began to heal recently after meeting a wonderful friend and felt like being free of my past.  For a year I was happy and able to cope with the changes, get into a relationship and start fresh.  But two months ago I happened to meet my uncle again for the first time since my healing in a family gathering. Nothing could prepare me about it and I felt real panic in his presence though I knew he couldn't touch me now. Since then I have been predominantly occupied by thoughts of sexual abuse, sex slavery, rape, incest and female objectification. I even want my partner to be really rough with me in bed. Am I relapsing into trauma of revictimising myself.",
      "Firstly I am sorry for what happened to you but glad you have come here. Although yours was a short post there are many issues. Firstly what you are experiencing is \"normal\"for what was an abnormal childhood. Even the way you are now looking to your partner during sex. I am no professional but feel that as long as they support you in this time and no physical harm is done, it is okay. Normal folks sometimes do a lot more than what you are doing. Does your partner know ?? Next your Uncle. Okay, he was caught, but did the family ignore it, forgive him, did he do time and is now out. Depending on the answer to the above will in some way change what I would say. Are you self harming in any way, or self medicating ??"

      "Hi I've been on PF for quite a few years. I've never had a diagnosis, but it's likely to be social anxiety disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. I've mostly identified as AvPD (as I fit all the criteria). Recently, I've started to wander if I could also have C-PTSD.  I was a victim of domestic abuse for my first 17 years ( physical/mental/emotional).  My mum left home when I was a teenager and was emotionally distant for many years. We only got close after the birth of my daughter. She would interfere and criticise me in front of her, or behind my back.  This had caused problems between my daughter and I.  For a time I had no support.  My mum passed away last year, and things are changing. I don't tend to dissociate, but am constantly lost in my thoughts and have maladaptive day dreaming.  I'm rarely in the real world, I'm always somewhere else.  I have recurrent dreams where I am shamed, embarrassed or the subject of someone's disappointment. These are not reliving actual experiences, just the emotions. I am nervous, withdrawn, expecting something bad to happen, and have extreme emotional reactions which I find hard to control. I don't think I'm in an unsafe environment anymore, bit rarely feel safe or at peace. What steps should I take?Any self help tips (I eat healthy, go to an anxiety support group, exercise, Journal and have started mindfulness). My GP is of the opinion that there's nothing further they can offer after being in the mental health system for 20+ years.  In the UK they don't tend to diagnose but prefer to focus on treatment. What else can I do?  Anyone else had treatment in the NHS",
      "Contine with what you are doing, and try to find some joy. Sometimes the best cure for bad memories is making happy ones. I am no professional but think working on what you are doing will yield  better results than exploring PTSD.",

      "Hey guys, I just had a question. Does anyone here also struggle with gender identity issues? I have for a while and I have been diagnosed with CPTSD. I have lately been questioning my gender identity and it doesn’t help that I also have bipolar and OCD. Is it possible that maybe I just have borderline, since all of these symptoms from these disorders tend to be in borderline (including identity disturbance) I’m not sure whether the trauma or the gender identity issues happened first because I have been abused my whole life. ( I was taken away from my mother by social services when I was a baby, but idk if that can affect gender)",
      "Not likely for C-PTSD, possible for BPD. How rapid cycling is this Bipolar II? How dependent are your ups and downs upon triggers?",
      "I actually just spoke to my old therapist and she told me that she was considering borderline and PTSD so I am assuming it’s because of the BPD but then again I keep second guessing myself. Also my mood swings are always dependent on triggers and stress and last at most a couple of hours. -- Wed Oct 25, 2017 8:48 am -- I actually just spoke to my old therapist and she told me that she was considering borderline and PTSD so I am assuming it’s because of the BPD but then again I keep second guessing myself.

      "Well given that ultrafast cycling bipolar disorder is essentially an unsubstantiated concept, and that bipolar cycles while they can be triggered by extreme stress are generally something that happens without a relationship trigger, I am going to say BPD is more likely to be correct. That said, I think I read somewhere you were 18. 18 is an extremely early age to be diagnosing a personality disorder or bipolar (for which patients typically wait somewhere between five and ten years).

      "So anyway, I've been diagnosed twice with Complex PTSD, but the thing is, I'm not exactly sure I have it (this may sound a bit dumb, read on..lol). I don't think I explained everything to them clearly, so there may have been a confusion or something,...so for you guys who have PTSD, ASD or know about it or whatever, can you please tell me what you think about this whole thing, I'll basically tell you what they 'thought' was flashbacks (I didn't explicitly explain all that to them well), so tell me if that's what it really is like, and I'll give you a list of my other symptoms. 'Flashbacks': I often get intrusive replays of the same really ######6 painful memories, that I try to push away at all costs. I often avoid reminders, and all that, because they set me off. I usually either feel numb, scared, hurt, or hurt-scared when I get them.  But most of the time, I'm just unbearably deeply hurt or numb. This is one reason, I think I may not have the disorder.  Sometimes they make me cry on the spot. I feel like I'm relieving the stuff. But it's not like a hallucination, and it's no like it's happening real time (which I've heard some ppl say flashbacks are like that). I also experience randomly, feeling like the ppl who did $#%^ to me are present, near me, and are going to hurt me again. And so I act like they're there, make myself small [ hit, tug on really tightly nearby stuff, try to make it pass by shaking my legs, forcing the stuff out, and all that.] (that's usually how I cope with memories) Other stuff: -I get random, intrusive images of stuff from those events. -Whenever I hear sounds, or see certain things who were present, I freak out and sometimes feel ######6 hurt. -I have a pretty bad startle response. Even the little things shake me up for a whole minute. -When I am in 'linked' situations, I unwillingly tune in my red vision. -It's psychologically really hard to even read, listen to music, that are somehow linked. I feel like I have to turn it the ###$ off. Or i feel dead, disconnected and unreal as well, when I tried doing those things. -When I see people do certain linked things, I automatically assume they are going to hurt me, even if it really stupid. I know it logically, but my emotions are out of control. -It's hard to talk about, and whenever I do talk about it to my therapists, I get uncontrollably scared, and I can't calm my self down. But I don't have \"flashbacks\" linked to touch, smell, or taste, I think.  So I'm not sure it's possible for me to have PTSD. Anyway you tell me.",
      "I think this does very much sound like PTSD.  The determining factor is that it becomes an immersive experience for you.  While on-going, it dominates your attention and you have bodily reactions that are consistent with the experience.  Those are classic, textbook symptoms of PTSD. Also the avoidance of triggers, which means you are able to understand & foresee what will happen to you when triggered, but are unable to bring it under control quickly once in progress.  Again a classic symptom. You seem to be questioning the concept of flashbacks and their triggers.  For some people these are very vivid and real (like replaying a video), and also may be triggered by the things you mention.  But the expression of PTSD can be much more general and varied than that.  People react and experience it in different ways.  I think your experiences would fall under the umbrella. Is there a reason why it bothers you to be diagnosed with PTSD?",
      "I have complex PTSD, and ASD (if by ASD you mean autism spectrum disorder oc - I have aspergers) I'm with avatar123 on this..   what you've described sounds very much the same as my experience of PTSD  and the associated flashbacks. I've only ever had 1 flashback that made me feel that i was right back there..   mine are usually the same as yours.. and like you i do feel like i'm reliving.. or immersed, but i'm also aware of the fact that i'm not actually there. Some (not many) people with complex PTSD actually don't experience visual or 'remembering' flashbacks at all (as in there's no conscious replay of memories happening in their mind at the time)..   but they do suffer from emotional flashbacks  (see Pete Walkers site for more detail on emotional flashbacks) xx",
      "You don't need to have flashbacks to have PTSD. Without knowing the cause I can't really say yes or no, but it sure could be. Who in hell is running around telling people that Flashbacks are THE part of PTSD. I get triggered now very rarely, I actually thought it was gone. But I can get \"emotional flash backs \"- ie: I may find my emotions to be the same as when I was in trauma. I have very good memory of what happened and those memories come up from time to time, but so do memories of my sporting achievements work incidents, bosses from 30 years ago."

      "I wanted to know if anyone has any suggestions/coping mechanisms for decreasing panic attacks and nightmares related to trauma. I can barely sleep and I'm having a lot of difficulty. I have a hard time controlling my emotions, intrusive thoughts, and anxiety and the sleep deprivation is making it worse. I got medication for PTSD (minipress) and I'm on Xanax, but I'm still having a lot of problems sleeping without nightmares and panic attacks. The lack of sleep is making it difficult to do my job.

I have been working with other negative emotions (sadness and anxiety) by acknowledging them and trying to process rather than fight them and it's been extremely helpful. Well, just wonderful to read you've began to form this mentality on your own already. Splendid. Utilizing the aid of a journal, as salted lipstick suggested, might be a good idea. Maybe I'm just scared that I will loose it if I let myself experience that fear. Understandable. Yet if you give in to this fear, even if only temporarily from a theoretical point of view, what would be the end result of losing control like that? It's never a bad idea to perform this excercise of visualization by carrying a certain (perhaps (partially) illogical) fear to its logical conclusion. Very helpful, i find. But I can see that it is probably the same (maybe more difficult) with fear that I will have to face it in order for my mind to let it go. Yes, to face, confront and allow the fear to be processed, otherwise the subconscious mind is going to continue putting you through trial until you finally decide to surrender to what, i think, the mind knows best needs to be done in order for you to heal from the pain, as the mind has an absolutely astounding innate intelligence, when it comes to knowing how to heal itself, among many other assets of its aptitude. 'Take home': That is very good advice. Mayhaps you all should be therapists. To serve a therapeutic function is something most of us humans are intrinsically capable of, since merely listening intently, with an alert presence of mind and caring heart, can already generate a wonderfully therapeutic effect, as the core of therapy simply revolves around the 'art' of true communication. Suppose we could all communicate as open-heartedly, transparantly, honestly and compassionately as we can envision ourselves to be capable of doing, the inter-personal world we'd create for ourselves would look wholly differently --- we'd all then have the capacity to serve some therapeutic function in relation to our selves and others, no matter how humbly that might be put into practice. As a final, light-hearted side-note i wanna bring to the reader's attention to a saying most of us probably are familiar with, which imparts that Music, therefore Art, can have a therapeutic effect. Alas, those therapists that've been conditionned to villify disorder without having been instructed to seek out the remedy from within, unfortunately have lost touch with the true nature of therapy, and are in a way living out quite a disharmony themselves. Excellent relevant and eye-opening quote to close it off by tieing it all together: ''The doctor is effective only when he himself is affected. ''Only the wounded physician heals.'' But when the doctor wears his personality like a coat of armor, he has no effect. I take my patients seriously. Perhaps i am confronted with a problem just as much as them. It often happens that the patient is exactly the right plaster for the doctor's sore spot. Because this is so, difficult situations can arise for the doctor too---or rather, especially for the doctor.'' - C.G. Jung"

      "This must be a very crazy thing as I have searched for hours and can not find anybody or anything talking about understanding. I do have PTSD (yes, I am working with a therapist) experience several different elements of anxiety (from physical panic attack to emotional attacks). Sometimes I am just fine and seem to function almost normally, but then there are times when things are bad in just one area (like I will have the ball in my throat feeling or jitters) sometimes it is just emotional (like all of a sudden I am panicked or want to cry and have no reason that I know for it) and sometimes it's a combination of things. What I am asking about today is even strange by my standards and it is something I have noticed mildly and occasionally for a long time, but seems to be happening a little more often lately. I seem to sometimes have a reaction to my own touch. It doesn't have to be my hands, it can even be my feet touching each other in bed or touching my other leg. Sometimes I will be trying to go to sleep and feel the anxiety building and realize it is because I am laying on my hand and my hand is touching my stomach. I try to ignore it and go to sleep because it is completely rediculous and crazy but I often have to change position so nothing is touching before it will settle down. I have even noticed that there are times when I have to try to keep my fingers apart and have pushed blanket between my fingers so they don't touch each other. Is this a condition that is known or just a very strange aspect of my anxiety and does anybody have any idea why it would be happening? I am trying to not get built up about it and have tried to ignore it for a very long time, but the longer it goes on the stranger it gets and I would like an idea of if there is a reason it is happening.

      "Oh don't worry -  we've got a wide range of crazy symptoms between all of us..   yours definitely isn't that weird. You mind if i ask what caused your PTSD?   Given the symptoms you're having, I'm guessing that you experienced trauma from a person or persons..? You might logically know that your own body part isn't a threat, but your PTSD doesn't know that..  all your triggered PTSD response knows is that you're being touched or restricted, and that thing that's touching you needs to be moved.. immediately. To start to lose those symptoms, It might be helpful to consider doing a small amount of massage on yourself.. paying particular attention to the areas that you've mentioned. It's also worth talking to your therapist to see if he/she can recommend any way to help you overcome those symptoms. Just checking quickly..   is there any chance at all that you may be on the autistic spectrum, or have sensory processing disorder? Because if so.. it's possible that the symptoms you describe, might actually be unrelated to the PTSD.",
      "Thanks so much for the input.  I have continued to research and still have not found a single mention of anything like this on the internet, and there's some strange things out there.. LOL In answer to your questions, ptsd is from early childhood and yes, person centered.  I did mention this vaguely to my therapist several months ago and the thought was that it was probably related.  Maybe it is just that, but it sure has gotten more intense lately if that is what it is from and has been there all my life.  I know I am not on the spectrum at all.  I am very familiar with all spectrum disorders and I don't fall into any of them, or even close.  I considered OCD, because that is what it is most similar to when I just look at symptoms, but it doesn't really fit that either and I have never had OCD issues in the past; so I am not leaning in that direction either.  I am most inclined to agree with you that it is related to the past, but just seems strange that it is manifesting so much lately and wasn't something I had noticed until recently. I do sure thank you for your input as I am pretty good at research and finding understanding in situations but this one has alluded me.",
      "You're more than welcome..  i do the same thing with researching everything until i've got an answer to something. Sounds almost like misophonia to me.. but for touch. When you're tired or overwhelmed, do you get any other touch issues at all? (problems with certain clothing/too much clothing).. Could the symptoms becoming stronger have anything to do with therapy at all?  I'm sure you've considered that already, but just in case -  you often find that any symptoms of ptsd tend to become more pronounced during the first part of therapy.",
      "It is very possible that there is a connection to therapy and the increase in frequency and intensity lately.  I don't have any issues with things such as clothing or touch to other things.  When this gets real bad, I can even put a blanket between my hand or foot and whatever it is touching, and then it is ok.  It seems to just be the skin on skin that triggers the anxiety.  It definitely has some type of trigger because as I am typing this now, I am laying on my bed with one foot again the inside of the other leg, figure 4; and I notice it but don't have that anxious sensation that I have to move it. I can't know for certain, of course, but I am still leaning toward a ptsd trigger issue.  Just not one I have ever heard of anyone having before.",
      "Well it's unusual.. but with abuse PTSD,  there are so many things that could end up being a trigger, that yours doesn't strike me as being too out there as symptoms go. Sorry for the question if it's uncomfy for you..  but is it just your skin?  Are you okay with someone else touching you?  Linking hands for example? i have a strange one myself I guess..  I can hold hands easily enough,  but if someone tries to entwine their fingers with mine, I have to pull away (feels totally trapping/enclosing/panic/fight or flight response inducing)",
      "It might have something to do with what trauma you experienced? I have problems if I put my hands touching in certain ways because I was made to do that as part of what I went through..."

      "If you haven't seen the show  \"Big Little Lies\" it has the best portrayal of PTSD from rape that I've ever seen. I couldn't believe how they nailed it: panic attacks, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, the works. A friend of mine said that she thought the character should just \"grow up\" and \"get over it.\" Even portrayed accurately it elicits the same response from ignorant people. Sometimes I feel so alone.",
      "Jen123 wrote: she thought the character should just \"grow up\" and \"get over it.\" Even portrayed accurately it elicits the same response from ignorant people. Sometimes I feel so alone. and that is about a bad a thing as anyone can say.. the average person is never tested, they assume that if they were, they could cope. I was at a robbery assault with 18 witnesses. the four with the best view, outside in the Mc\"Donald's play ground, disappeared so fast you could' only see the dust. (they were safe with brick and glass wall between them and the assailants), of the other 14 only 4 were deemed credible witnesses, and only two made a id of the perps. I can tell you that before that happened everyone there would have been confident of being a good witness and made a positive id. People kid themselves. and I was one of two knocked out and one of two who made the id. I put the bastard away.",
      "Agreed, people often seem to think that they could deal with things better. Maybe it is because they can't stand feeling as vulnerable as they really are.  I think maybe it is more about self-preservation. We are a reminder of danger and vulnerability. It makes us who have had our vulnerability shoved  in our faces feel alone and like no one even tries to understand our situation. It's hard for me to take  when I feel them looking down on me and I know that they most likely would not fare better. I want to tell them, \"Hey look! I went through this awful thing and am mostly keeping my life together even though it's so hard it's at the limits of what people can handle. I'm tough! You don't even KNOW if you're tough!\""

      "Hey there everyone, So I asked this in another forum, but after some thought, I figured I ought to post a similar question in this forum too. My question is, how do you live in the present when you still have trauma work that you are focusing on? I'm trying to work more on my trauma, but I feel that in order to do that, I need to first learn how to stay in the present so I don't get swamped or overwhelmed with the work I'm wanting to do.",
      "I've found that having something to keep me \"grounded\" in the present helps. It can be something small, like the feel and weight of the yarn as I crochet a potholder, or the vibration of the violin, or even a smell or taste. Wishing you all the best. SilverRain",
      "I've been working a lot on grounding and staying in the present too recently. I can manage with a lot of work, but only for short periods of time. It's HARD. The things I've found might not work for you but hopefully something will. 1. I close my eyes and listen to every single sound I can hear. You would not believe how much sound there is around us all of the time. People, wind, crickets, birds, humming of machines, water, footsteps, talking, it goes on and on.  I first try to identify every individual sound and this takes a little work because initially I can only pick up a couple, but I start to hear things that I never paid attention to before. Sometimes all the sounds then blend together into a cacophony of sound. That is like meditation. Even if I can't get there, just listening and identifying sounds brings me back a bit. I learned this after my therapist taught me to identify sights, sounds, and physical sensations so I think that it might work better for some people with other senses, sound just works best for me. 2. Deep breathing WITH movement. Deep breathing alone never worked very well for me. Adding in arm movements by putting my arms in the air when I breath in and folding down to the ground and touching the floor when I breath out works way better than breathing alone. Sometimes I do this in a bathroom stall if I'm out with people and not at home. 3. Taking a shower. When intrusive thoughts are bad and I'm at home alone, taking a shower can reset me sometimes and bring me back to the present. 4. Exercise. What doesn't exercise work for! Exercise puts my mind on my body and what I'm feeling and gets me out of my head. 5. Being in nature. Nature really helps bring me back to reality. If I can't see the beauty around me then I know I'm seriously dissociated. If I have the time I will sit and do the breathing/listening exercises until I can bring myself to the present enough to enjoy where I am (sometimes this literally takes hours). But if I'm not that far gone just being out in nature alone will bring me to the present. 6. Yoga. Breathing exercises, but also putting all of my concentration on every part of my body in the poses and concentrating on fluid movements really brings me back to planet earth. 7. Exploring a new place. Exploring somewhere you haven't been before focuses your attention on what's around you and not what's in your head. This works really well for me. Try walking a different way to the store, etc. Well that's all for me. Like I said each time is difficult and the effectiveness or duration of benefit vary EVERY SINGLE TIME for me. It's a struggle, but I've heard once you get good at it you can bring yourself back to reality quickly. I hope we both get there!"

      "To start; I'm new. I joined because some of the thoughts that go through my mind are so socially unacceptable that it's actually painful to consider telling someone in person. So anyway, I'm thirteen years old. It's sort of necessary to explain my history, but I have a TL;DR note at the end. I don't go into too many graphic details, just facts. From birth to age ten, I can't say I remember very much, but I do know that I was sexually abused around the age of five, once by a family friend and multiple times by a neighbor(neither could have been any older than 15). That's the least of my worries because I didn't even consider this to be abnormal until I grew up, although I do feel unclean, since I've converted to Christianity. Then there's a gap, with a few bits of memory until I was about ten. Physical abuse was at its worst, which came along with emotional/psychological, and acting out/bad behavior(smoking, drinking, running away, etc.) on my part. At this time, I told my school counselor that my home was unsanitary(surprise!). So, then came foster care, although I don't(and certainly didn't in the past[however I knew that the state of our home was illegal]) consider myself to be neglected, because I had grown up living in the kind of filth that's probably hard for you to imagine. I think I hit quite the \"jackpot\" with the variety in my abuse, heh. More emotional abuse followed, as my siblings ostracized me(since I had been the one to report our mother). Following that, I stopped taking my antidepressants as a sort of rebellion. Almost immediately, I quit being such a nightmare. In hindsight, the meds most likely affected my mood negatively. My siblings warmed up to me afterwards. I can say that for a couple weeks, I was happy. Happy? But not to worry! In the distance, like a white knight, was anxiety . My fear of death and what follows, a reoccurring fear throughout my life. This stage was most terrifying of all that I can remember. But ah--my faith/religion triumphed in that one. And now I feel great. jkjkjk. Now I have an eating disorder(I wish I was making this up, genuinely, but I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa about a month ago, after years of the occasional throwing-up-after-large-meals, which I didn't see as a problem) and have missed more school than I've attended, due to my health. Since it's relevant; I've mentioned to my mother that if I could lose 50 lbs. instantly, I wouldn't. I love starving myself, and being underweight would mean I wouldn't be able to do so without larger, more visibly obvious issues. It isn't about my appearance here. I think it's important to note that there was a point when I was looking to recover from anorexia. Until then, I knew that 5-20% of those with my illness would die--and I didn't care. But as soon as I started to care again, to worry about my health, my fear of death returned. And my disordered eating habits have come back with a passion at the time I'm writing this. TL;DR After everything I've put myself through, I still can't seem to find happiness, and it seems almost like I don't want to. As I've come of highschool/teen age, I've been romanticizing about the idea of having an abusive partner. I'm logical enough to be aware of my thoughts, and how dangerous it can be if I find myself in that sort of situation, especially on purpose. Why am I doing this to myself, and how can I get out of this? I feel so helpless. Especially considering the last six months I've been struggling with my eating disorder, I know that if I continue with this mindset, I will die an early death. *Sorry, it's lengthy. I'm not trolling, honest to God. And sorry for my stupid jokes. I don't mean to make light of this sort of thing. Just a bit easier to talk about, that way.",
      "I'm not really in a position to give advice. But something that has helped me (in relation to other challenges in my life) is radical self-acceptance and self-love. You have nothing to be ashamed about. Everything you feel and think is normal, not shameful. Accept your feelings and thoughts, even the ones that seem to you to be 'bad'. You are not bad, you are human. Some bad stuff happened to you, but none of it was your fault. I love this quote from Kristin Neff: \"Unlike self-criticism, which asks if you're good enough, self-compassion asks what's good for you?\" Don't know if that helps at all, but I just wanted to share what's helped me...",
      "Hi reine and welcome First off, I'm sorry to hear about all that you have been through and are struggling with. That's a lot for any one person to deal with. reine wrote: Why do I crave abuse/unhappiness? For many people, the short answer to craving abuse is that we crave what we know. To put yourself in an abusive situation is to put yourself in a situation that you couldn't previously resolve (e.g. you couldn't make your physical and sexual abusers treat you with dignity), and gives you an opportunity to \"get it right\" by seeing if you can make your abusers treat you better. Of course, in reality if you find yourself in an abusive relationship, unconsciously trying to fix past problems by seeking out similar people and issues , you don't end up fixing them, you end up suffering more abuse. You seem to be aware that it's not a good idea to be romanticising an abusive partner, but until you can work through your feelings about how your past experiences have effected you, it is difficult to be attracted to more healthy people. Anorexia is often about self harm as well as reducing anxiety. You could be treating your body the way others have treated you (emotionally and perhaps other ways) by not giving yourself nourishing and adequate food and keeping it all down. Eating properly is a type of love for oneself and you could be essentially repeating the pattern of how others have treated you badly. Also, sometimes anorexia can be about controlling anxiety. You haven't had a lot of control over your situation and what you have been through. Choosing what you do with your food can be a way to take back your power. It can also be a way to take back your power physically if it means abuse might be less likely to happen for some reason (e.g. perhaps you might unconsciously think that if you are skinny or if you are vommiting, people won't find you sexually attractive). I don't know what's true for you, I just wanted to give you a rough idea of some common ways that patterns can play out in unconscious thinking and perhaps you can have a think about if you think any of this might apply to you..."

      "I had a rough childhood (emtional abuse, neglect, abandonment). I have no Memory until relatives took me to them with the Age of 8 (my parents where more than happy to get rid of me, I had no room, just a bed in the room of my sister). Emotional flashbacks and other Problems still haunting em. I'm 28 now (male). I'm adicted to cozy, soft and warm things (maybe because I didnt get them as a Baby??). Last weeks I figured out I feel safer/better when I Dress in cozy Girl clothes (woolen pantyhose and oversized Pullover, jumpsuit Pyjama, ...). I'm really ashamed, that I do this because it is not ok for a man. This has nothing to do with sex, just calm me down and make my feel better. That keeps the deamons and emotional flashbacks away. I'm to ashamed to tell this my therapist. So I would like to hear what you think about that.",
      "Okay that is different. Do you think it is worse than drugs, booze, promiscuity, hoarding, shopping addiction (or worse yet shopping addiction + hoarding) I'm okay with it, as long as it does not get sexual because then it really is another issue.",
      "Why are you ashamed to tell your therapist that you are comforted by these things and clothes?  It's unlikely that your therapist would be at all judgemental. Your therapist is there to help you with your problems and they can't help you if you don't tell them. It's just a thing you are struggling with and there is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to wear clothes that make you feel comfortable and safe and to have other soft, cozy, warm things to help you also. It sounds like you want to stop wearing the girl clothes, have you tried finding any equivalently cozy man clothes to see if you can replicate that safe feeling? Or do you think it's more the fact that they are clothes of the opposite gender that is making you feel safer? Did your sister suffer the same abuse as you? Perhaps if she didn't, you are feeling like it is the girl clothes that made her safer?",
      "Strange thought perhaps, but Salted Lipsticks thought about your sister made me think of it..   I was wondering if maybe by dressing in cozy, soft, and warm females clothing, makes you feel a bit like you're being cuddled by the mother you should have had.  Basically trying to mother yourself..(?) and tbh..   it sounds actually really comforting..   so if it works for you, and doesn't cause too many problems for you, then I can't see it as a bad thing. Please do speak to your therapist about this if you'd like to..  if your therapist judges you in any way for that, then you should probably find a new therapist xx",
      "My sister is the golden child. Everything she does is perfect in the eyes of my parents. Interesting, she is unemployed for years. But I never wanted to be like my sister. trying to mother yourself ... could be, don't know. I had another thought. Maybe my uncautionous mind want to be someone else? Someone with caring parents? I cant tell this my therapist. I'm doing it secretly."

      "Hi everyone, I'm new here. My name's Maggie. I've been in love with a PTSD survivor for three years but as he's pretty ill we're not actually dating or even seeing each other regularly. He only recently confessed to me that he's a childhood trauma survivor (didn't specify) and said he doesn't remember whole days of his life, only going to bed at night. When I met him, he could barely speak to anyone and was extremely withdrawn. I persevered and after some time he started to trust me. He told me he badly wanted to talk to people but felt like every time he opened his mouth the earth just swallowed him up. Both his mom and brother have tried to commit suicide more than once, and his dad was hijacked in their driveway at home and nearly died from gunshot wounds but recovered. This guy is 25 but has never had a relationship, never had more than a few friends from childhood, and yet is very together in every other respect - drinks in extreme moderation, has a black belt in karate (he was my sensei at the dojo, although he has since left), doesn't take drugs, has a job and works really hard. The thing is, although he wants to get closer to me, he struggled. I'm trying to understand what's going through his mind. He told me his worst fear is rejection and abandonment. I have told him I'm planning to be his friend for ever, no matter what, and I mean it, too. He's an awesome guy and we sometimes text for five hours or more - he's very witty with a strong character. But he said because of his past he will sometimes push me away and can't help it. In the beginning, we went out a few times, then he started to cancel, but if I ignored him for any length of time he would get really upset with me (tearful, etc.). Currently he will manage to go out once in a blue moon and I will need to ask him several times first. He makes many excuses and I have learnt to say, \"No problem, buddy, whenever you have time.\" I once said to him, \"It sounds like you don't want to go - should I stop asking?\" This was before I knew he had PTSD. He got very upset and said, \"But I want to go.\" When we do meet up, he is very tense with closed-off body language, but he often starts to tell me stuff and I think that is upsetting to him on some level. I have tried to just have light-hearted meetings with him, so that he doesn't feel too stressed. He just seems to be quite strung out with me, however. He used to have a massive crush on me, with all the signs - blushing, hands shaking, staring into my eyes, etc. but that was three years ago and he's calmed down a lot since then! Since we became close, he said he doesn't have nightmares any more and wakes up in a good mood, which is really good. He gets really jealous if another guy flirts with me, however, and was upset that one of the guys in our dojo was treating me 'inappropriately'. He said if I was uncomfortable I should tell him and he would speak to the guy in question. A couple of months ago I told him I love him, but said it sort of lightly, and said it was unconditional and his peace was more important to me than my own. I guess what I was to ask is, how should I behave towards him? I read somewhere that it's insulting to suggest to someone with PTSD that you don't have any expectations of them whatsoever - but on the other hand, I don't want him to feel pressured regarding going out, I want to be accepting and let him be what he is. What is the best way to walk this path? And please don't tell me to give up on him. Even if we can't have a relationship, I want him to know I'm his best friend and will never let him down. I have seen him make such incredible progress since I first met him, when he was a real lone wolf with nobody to talk to. He used to say to me, \"I am alone and hurt and I think I will be alone for the rest of my life, people just leave after a while, they don't give me a chance.\" How do I give him a chance while still maintaining my own self-respect and self-love?",
      "Anyone??",
      "Sorry for the delay. Not sure what I can say but I will just put some stuff out there. If this is child abuse related I think the level of isolation survivors build is partially due to the extent of the abuse. Factors in that are his current relationship with the abusers. Whether he was isolated in the abuse. (lived in a house with no support - either both parents abusing or one abusing and the other enabling, allowing the abuse to happen). How extreme was the abuse How long did it go on for. The reason I mentioned all that is that, is a survivor will be effected up to a certain point in a way. They will have attachment issues and mistrust, self esteem issues etc. Goes farther and they will become - \"all I need is food and a place to sleep - a safe place to sleep\". Their family relationships are totally gone, and they will be molded by how successful the \"eat + sleep \" strategy have been. Believe it or not their confidence is based on the \"I survived\" mentality. There is mistrust and there is completely broken trust and no respect for authority. Relationships with survivors are difficult. If you have not learned to trust someone then being with someone can make that other person feel quite challenged. We will do stuff that for us is normal but that to others may be socially not correct or challenging. We take time to learn our social skills. We can do it, but it is usually difficult. If you hate crowds, meeting new people, then you are not going to learn appropriate socialization. You say he is good at work, I am intrigued as to what he does. I have been a very successful (if you count $$$ as a measure) accountant. The people thing I still find challenging, but as a survivor you wind up, Drug Addict, alcoholic, promiscuous, hoarder, shopping addict, or workaholic. (I am workaholic, shopping addict, and hoarder - I call myself a collector - because I enjoy it and am in denial) . Is he a workaholic? Not a specific answer to your question, but something to build on.",
      "I have some advice - other stuff in the extreme abuse category, but if he just a sensitive person dealing with crap then I may be steering you down a rabbit hole. Honestly one of the issues with the more extreme end is we have no idea what sort of person we could have been. Extroverts can be very quite and isolated, we give off all the wrong clues.",
      "Hi Terry Thanks for responding, I appreciate it. I see you're a survivor but you take the time to be there for others - it's a great help to many, I'm sure. He has not specified the nature of the abuse, but his mom and brother have both tried to kill themselves on a number of occasions. I know his mom is depressive and posts a lot about survival on Facebook. My friend said he was an unwanted 2nd child and was made to feel it and basically raised himself. He said his parents fight all the time and he's grown up with that. He said he's so used to waiting in hospital rooms he should buy shares in them. The only time I met his parents was at our dojo, at his black-belt grading. His mom was completely overdressed and my first thought was that she was a trophy wife. I greeted and congratulated her on her son's achievement and she just stared at me, didn't even respond. He told me later that this was during a very bad period of his parents' fighting. He said he remembers being screamed at a lot growing up, but he has blanked out whole days of his childhood and remembers only going to bed at night. He has grown up with a fierce sense of survival - he studies absolutely everything about safety and security and reads 'The Art of War' all the time and became a black belt at 23. He said after his dad was hijacked he basically started putting everything in his room ready for the next crisis - clothes ready, shoes right next to the bed, etc. He said he always expects the worst but that is being prepared. He said he fears losing control but also fears rejection and abandonment more than anything in the world. If I were to go to the dojo and not greet him immediately, for example, he would go into 'meltdown' and get tears in his eyes. The other day he told me I am spiritual 'family' and we have a deep connection, but he also said he has no intention of being in a relationship with me - despite the fact that he crushed on me for two years (we became friends this year, the 3rd year). The thing is, he still lives at home, at 25, as he can't afford to move out yet (well, he said he doesn't just want to move into a tiny flat just to be independent). He works as a coder and got his first job in January last year. Yes, he is a workaholic and says he wants to retire in 20 years' time. He said he won't go into therapy because \"literally nobody cares\" but he has begged me to give him time because \"all I need is time and patience\". He has come a long way since I first met him, when he couldn't say more than a few words to people. He has three good friends from his childhood and spends all his time with them; otherwise, he said he spent his university years hiding out (he even took me to a pond he used to go and sit beside, in a little park). So he trusts me enough to confide in me, but struggles to go out with me. The last time I saw him outside of the dojo was in April. He wants to tell me things, and we sometimes chat for five hours or more, but he also avoids me in person because he gets vulnerable with me, and I think he hates that. He drinks very little, doesn't take drugs, doesn't spend money (always in the same old clothes), works all the time (his dad's self-employed and the business sometimes struggles, so he helps him).",
      "Thanks, check back in a few days. There is some stuff there I can help you with. Apart from the Dojo do you two take in movies, go out to eat. Do you live at home ?? and thanks for the nice words. This site has done wonders for me.",
      "Thanks, Terry, I will do. I would greatly appreciate any advice/help you are able to offer. It means a lot to me, because he means the world to me. I am a lot older than him - a lot - and divorced. I think the fact that I am pretty relaxed about life helps, although things were very intense between us in the beginning. We have managed to go out for coffee a few times, we went hiking twice, and he took me to a little park where he used to 'hide out'. Other than that, we haven't managed anything else. He cried off going to an expo with me. I think it was just too much, especially as I said I'd give him a lift as he didn't know where the place was. Our interests are all aligned - martial arts, meditation, spirituality, hiking, reading, gaming. He relaxes more when we go out now - previously, it could be excruciating as sometimes he would be in a bad way and not able to say much at all. Now he chats and laughs, even though he is still quite tense. I'm so glad the site is doing good things for you! I hope you're doing okay. It's quite a hard and lonely road, from what I can see, and not many people 'get it'.",
      "Hi Terry, so he's said we can meet next weekend, but whether he'll go through with it or not remains to be seen. If you have any advice in the meantime, it would be great. I'd just like to know how to handle everything.",
      "I don't want this to sound uncomfortable but have the two of you been intimate, or do you think that is something he is afraid of ?? You say you are older, are there children at home with you ??",
      "No, we haven't been intimate. The most 'intimate' we've been is when he hugged me very, very close at his black-belt grading. He is very scared on closeness, but I think he was just very 'out of the usual' state after his grading. I don't have any kids."

      "There is so much association of ptsd to military- and that's true there's a lot of veterans who have it. Another top cause of ptsd is domestic violence victims-- it has been stated in psychological pieces on what is known about domestic violence is that it is quite similar to living in a combat or war zone. I can vouch for that. There needs to be more public awareness campaigns and funding and programs for domestic violence ptsd victims-- for example programs specifically for dv victims to receive a therapy or service pet. I won't spend time on elaborating on all the many other things that should be offered also to dv victims of ptsd. This post is just to ask other dv victims any things that help them with intense emotions that overcome them- in July I came very close to taking my own life. It's a daily fight to make it through- dv victims will know what I'm talking about. I was in a serious car accident a few years back and not to discount the ptsd that can arise from that but it's different because in dv, it is a person you have presumably loved and cared about and have a deep bond with. Stockholm syndrome etc... the minor trauma I have from that horrible car accident is nothing compared to the trauma from living a life with the man who was at least at some point the love of my life, someone I had a long history and bond with, shared a life with, memories (not all bad- some were very good as most dv victims could understand) so it is a complex ptsd is what I've been told. It makes me feel like a broken person-- it's profoundly affected me on so many levels that go deep and complex- layers of all different stuff. I was in a doctor office waiting room , all was okay, soft music not many people, having my cold beverage to sip on and was just kind of relaxing waiting there when a couple came in- I could subtly pick up on it appeared the man was kind gentle and regarded his partner as an equal human in their relationship- subtle things can have big effects-- I suddenly got overcome with flashbacks of my bf treating me like a thing- an object sometimes- pulling my hair and pushing me, yelling at me like a second class slave person- this took place in milliseconds- the comparison in my mind between the two- the reality of a man treating his gf as an equal human with kindness and dignity, and the vast contrast of how I was treated for years. My face got hot, heart beating heavy breathing fast etc, I had to bite my lip and felt like I was on a roller coaster of intense overtaking painful emotion. I have had to quickly exit stores, cafes, etc because of being suddenly triggered. Left a meal half eaten at a little cafe where I was trying to treat myself and a song came on. Sudden out of the blue intense memories flashbacks- got my purse and quickly made a beeline for the door- didn't even bother to get a doggy bag for my half eaten food. Oh how much he's taken from me. The time he was sentenced to it occurred to me is a lighter sentence than what I have been given. The ptsd is like being handicapped and it just is- it's true. I carry doctor prescribed meds for anxiety with me at all times, sometimes I bring a small frozen ice pack to hold on my face, always carry a tall cold beverage of water or tea, a picture of my dad, it's like I need a survival tote back at all times and often those aren't even enough. I'm afraid at some point I'll hit rock bottom like back in July and get suicidal again. I just think of all he took and I also struggle like other dv victims can relate to the fact he wasn't a stranger- he was the man I loved with all my heart so at the same time there is intense loss and grief on top of it. So if there's any dv victims here who can offer my any advice or even just words that will give me a helpful perspective or strength or hope please weigh in-- even if your not a dv victim but have a lot of understanding of that and the complexity of issues and emotions involved I also appreciate any helpful thoughts Thank you",
      "My understanding of child abuse PTSD (similar) is that if you experience an accident ptsd incident then you will also suffer an acute PTSD reaction linked to your child hood trauma. Happened to me I was at a robbery, so I can vouch for it.I had repressed it for 40 years. After the accident I was a mess, not from the robbery  but from my abuse. It all started to come back. Just saying that car accident may have been a triggering issue. It is very difficult to go forward without changing who you are. On that I cannot offer advice but I know people with time do go forward. How long ago did it happen?? You also learn to deal with triggers. The big one is to realise that you are actually having a hyper arousal or hyper vigilance reaction and telling yourself not to act on it. It will pass."

      "Hi, I had an episode of feeling not real or human. Like I didn't exist and I don't matter. It was really hard and I felt like hurting myself, mostly out of anger for the way I had been treated by my father yesterday. I am overwhelmed with emotions. I have been trying to confront him for abusing me when I was a kid and he totally ignored my feelings and justified his actions. I couldn't even speak anymore after he spoke for a while, but I was overwhelmed with emotions once I was home. I have moments like this but yesterday was a pretty extreme situation because I am trying to be more honest with him about the way he hurt me. My mother today told me that he called her to say he felt bad for the way he treated me. Her. He called her. Like I am not worthy of acknowledgement as a human being with feelings, he has to go to her and try to deal with her in this situation. I feel really weird and overwhelmed. I don't know what I'm feeling but I guess it's anger and maybe some outrage or disgust. I am just feeling so ignored and like I don't matter. Like I don't exist. I know I don't need my father to validate my existence but this is really making me feel bad and just unreal. I am trying hard to breathe but this is so hard. To breathe right.",
      "I'm so sorry you're feeling overwhelmed. I have a friend going through something similar, he says he does not feel real and when he opens his mouth to speak it is like the ground opens up and swallows him. How are you now? I see you posted this a while ago.",

I've decided to stop trying to talk things out with my father about the abuse, and just leaving things alone. It's better for my mental health. Plus he's old and looks like he's not interested in getting to know me better. What a waste. I'm sorry to hear your friend is suffering with the same feelings. I've been having to do lots of grounding exercises pretty much every day now to help me with those feelings of dissociation. I'm in therapy for these issues. Does your friend have any help with it?",

I think I've been coming around to seeing things this way, as I notice I've been happier without trying to stress over my relationship with my dad. He triggers a lot of flashbacks and overwhelming emotions for me. Even then, I thought it was selfish of me to not try harder to be closer to him. I am still being helped by him indirectly so I felt I owed him more, but honestly I don't feel like he has to help me and I'm trying to lean more on other people for emotional support. It's also been hard to accept that-- it's ok not to call him, if I don't want to. I"

      "He was just sentenced to some years in prison for keeping me held against my will that day with threats to seriously injure me and put me in the hospital if I tried to leave, then assaulted me. It wasn't the first time. Two months before he was arrested there was a day from hell, shocked nobody heard or called 911-- that day two months later when he attacked me a stranger did call 911. But two months earlier one day he was so violent, first verbally threatening screaming, etc, again held me against my will for a while with the threat of putting me in the hospital if I tried to leave, when we got back home walking up to the front door he slammed me against the hard stucco wall and grabbed me by the throats again threatening me.... inside he began hitting me and got on top of me on the couch choking me til I nearly passed out. It went on and on, I ran to the bathroom when he went to the kitchen and he forced himself inside the bathroom and of course resumed punching and choking me.. I made myself drop to the ground and begged him sobbing to stop. The rest of the day I was off balance, I noticed one of my eyes was bloodshot, and I had a vibrating noise in my head, I felt something was off in my head from the ounches and choking but he wouldn't let me go to a doctor. That day didn't seem real, it was a mild sunny day in early spring, people driving by, when he had me locked in the car some clueless woman walked by and pretended to not see... I couldn't understand how the world around me looked so normal and people going about their lives while I was being held in a car being threatened that he would pound my head in the pavement and I would be eating out of a straw in intensive care. Later at home our house was at end of a cup de sac, but still it seemed like with his screaming and threats someone would've heard, maybe they didn't or maybe they were guilty of just not doing anything to help like call 911. I thought that day my life might be taken or I would be carried away on a stretcher finally. Ironic it was a young girl of about 24 who called 911 that day two months later- she wouldn't stop following us after she saw and wasn't afraid. Other times there had been grown men in their fifties who didn't try to help or make a call. After he was sentenced later that day I felt a growing heaviness and depression, a sadness as I realized more and more how much he took from me and that despite his jail sentence my sentence is longer and tougher to carry. The day to day struggle-- thoughts memories that intrude in my mind, a simple song playing in a store sends me almost running for the door to get out, the sight of a road I remember with overwhelming despair and trauma where one time he beat me all over my head and face. I carry anxiety medication with me 24/7 in case and need it often at least every other day. I have learned tricks like someone in a combat zone how to quickly get the hell out of somewhere if I start to feel too triggered-- I have had to leave grocery shopping undone , from having to suddenly leave a store, I've had to leave a nice lunch of soup and bread at a relaxing cafe I wanted to treat myself to had to leave the food half eaten because once again I had become triggered and had to practically run out of the restaurant, I get overcome with a sadness, a despair when I simply see a man treating a woman with love gentleness and respect as an equal. I think to myself \"well these things I don't know about- I feel like I'm from another planet... I had always just simply wished for him to see me as an equal human being in our long relationship and to be loving and gentle. At times he was- most people who know about dv know the abuser has times they are loving and nice etc. but so many times he treated me like almost a slave or god forbid, almost like a thing. He would tell me oftentimes to shut up if he simply didn't want me to express something - in ordinary conversation partners have, even just an interesting story I saw on tv- shut up.. if I didn't sometimes he would use physical slap or hit to make me shut up. One of the most humiliating memories I have is we had once bumped into a friend- he was at the same fast food place and came and sat down to chat for a short bit- we were all just chatting nothing serious, just making light hearted convo, I can't recall what exactly I had said but know it was nothing wrong when he told me to shut up, right in front of that friend. His friend told him it wasn't cool and don't tell me to shut up. He acted all apologetic and acknowledged he shouldn't have said that, then the friend said he had to get going. I feel he got off light for what he did - he didn't appear to have remorse or feel bad for what he did, and made no attempt to make a statement of remorse to me at end of hearing. I keep asking why... sometimes I feel it's best to learn from the lesson and be gentle on myself and slowly try to heal... but the flashbacks and painful memories of being treated like a thing are overwhelming to me- like a daily fight within myself to make it through . Living in domestic violence is imo a worse or complex type of ptsd because a person who was supposed to care for and love you hurt and in my case even threatened to harm and kill me. He took so much. Not everything was physical in the technical sense-- he smashed and broke the air conditioner vent on my car and refused to repair it and I didn't have the money. He also threw away a watercolor painting I spent several hours to create. Worse, he threw my beloved fathers st Anthony medal away and I never got it back- it was given to me after my dad past away a few years ago and meant so much to me. I can't describe the pain and injustice of knowing all these things he won't ever return to me. That's another part of the trauma- the loss of self worth of feeling like I was a thing to him at times instead of a valuable human being that he loved and cared for. I can't put in words adequately to describe the magnitude of all that lost. Pls weigh in if you can offer any words that could help me out of this hole. He got a lighter sentence than me- because he's a narcissist and doesn't feel particularly bad or responsible for what he did, he doesn't carry trauma or despair, he doesn't feel like a thing, all the things I lost he didn't. So.. it seems like he got off easy with a much lighter sentence than me. Any sincere thoughts of what might help lift me out of this hole would be appreciated- thanks"

      "On the last day of fifth grade, which was Spring of 1998, I was dared by a neighborhood kid to climb a very tall tree and jump from the tree to a set of stairs that led to the upper level of an apartment building. I didn't get enough momentum and I fell about 15 feet onto pavement and had the wind knocked out of me. At the hospital they said I had high enzyme levels, meaning the shock caused my glands to oversecrete, but I didn't break any bones. Since that day, I've tended to zone out a lot and wonder if the fall could've caused chronic PTSD.",
      "PTSD is classed as such by meeting the criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). After a quick search, the criteria for PTSD can be found many places but it is laid out fairly clearly here: http://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/D ... 1-2014.pdf To know if you have PTSD you would need to get a diagnosis from a professional. It certainly sounds like a horrible experience either way, that's a big fall. zpublic wrote: Since that day, I've tended to zone out a lot Some level of dissociation is normal. If you are starting to feel it might be enough to be problematic though, that might not be normal. In what ways has your zoning out effected you? Do you find any particular situations where your zoning out is more frequent/problematic?",
      "When I zone out I usually think about a book, movie or show and how it is made, even when it's not available. I frequently feel like I'm being shown things that are disturbing and then being told that it's supposed to be disturbing and there's little to nothing I can do to stop the exposure to trauma."

      "I've done a quick search on here but can't find anything. I was recently told about \"rewind technqiue\" a form of therapy for PTSD. I can't find much about it online. Has anyone got any experience with it. I'm under the impression it's a \"double disassociation \" form of therapy. One thing that concerns with tat is that it may be dismissive in some way, a bit like CBT not getting to the route of the issues.",
      "Not sure what you mean by CBT not getting to the root of the problems. It's pretty much only done that for me. Anyway though, I have heard of the technique you're talking about, and somewhat have worked with it. I think it's crucial you have someone there with you that you trust, so you can push through it. Otherwise the exercise will be too overwhelming and all you've tried will be for nothing...likely making the PTSD issues worse the next time.",
      "CBT is all the rage in the UK, not sure where you are but I had a therapist once say that \"it's like using a sticking plaster \" & I agree, having tried it myself for GAD. Perhaps you could you tell me more about how the rewind technique work? Absolutely you need someone you trust, I've had a few bad therapists over the years only recently got recognition for PTSD. I've been doing my own coping mechanism with it where I put an older version of myself in the room for support, have been doing that for years. Is it something like this?"

      "I experienced a manic episode beginning a year and a half ago. I did so many things, said so many things, ruined every single one of my relationships, lost my job, among other things that I don't even want to go into. I humiliated myself publicly, and my life fell apart before I knew it. Now, About a year since, I am still experiencing negative intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY. Multiple times a day I get flashbacks of conversations I had, images of my doing something I forgot I did, looks people gave me when I was talking to them.. I seize up and have anxiety attacks. I cannot function in my daily life a lot of the time. I can't really think about other things because my mind is constantly tormenting me. Is this a form of PTSD? I did not witness any physical violence. I just want to get better. THank you",
      "I am not an expert but don't think it would be classic PTSD. What happened will leave tracks and it would be impossible not to think about the \"why am I here\" every day, and many times each day. I really hope that someone is helping you with what caused the issue and that you can start to rebuild. Take care."

      "I will try to keep this as short as possible because there's so many keep details it would take forever to get into everything leading up to this situation and what happened afterwards. Pretty much, I was raped then sexually assaulted again by an ex boyfriend a month later. I kept quiet about it until the next time where he pushed me against the wall and tried to put his hand up my dress and was feeling all over me. I tried to get away and he kept pulling me back. That's the day I decided enough was enough. I was tired of him being controlling, tired of him grabbing my wrists and pushing me against the wall. I was fed up of it all. I tried to make excuses for him raping me the previous month. Maybe he \"didn't mean it\", maybe he \"couldn't control himself\" or maybe it was even my fault becahse we had sex before and maybe I led him on because I let him touch me but then changed my mind and told him no. I tried getting away, I cried and begged but he didn't stop. He continued to take off my clothes touch me and penetrate me with his fingers. I remember every single feeling I had. That day, up until the next year which was filled with nothing but court dates and meetings with lawyers. I told the story over and over to the point I was sick. From *mod edit*, was nothing but hell. I quit school and started online classes. He got to stay at school. He was found not guilty and the judge completely bashed me. Called me manipulative and a liar pretty much. It kills me because I had a CONFESSION from this guy. He admitted he raped me and I recorded it. I was told he only admitted it because he was in love with me. I went home. *mod edit* nearly a year later he breaks the restraining order and starts liking my photos on instagram. I called the cops and I requested to see a different judge. This one locked him up for a few days. *mod edit* was the last day I stepped foot in a court room. So almost a year ago. A lot has happened since then. I graduated highschool and start college Monday. He got kicked out of his adoptive parents house because apparently he gave his cousin a hickey on vacation and his parents beat the crap out of him and he called child protective services on them. He then moved in with his adoptive brother and his wife, got kicked out of there for unknown reasons. Then he moved back with his birth mother. He hadn't seen her since he was 9. I talked to her on the phone and she was extremely nice. Nothing like this adoptive mother in which she went around calling me a liar and harassing me. His adoptive mother said her son came to her and admitted what he did to me. She kept apologizing. She said she tried to get him help but he wouldn't take it so she had to kick him out. She said his behavior was awful, and he got fired from his job for apparently sexually harassing a girl. Not assault but harassing. I kept in contact with him because in my mind, it's the only thing that made the situation seem not as bad as it was. It made me feel normal in a way, like it wasn't so terrible. All of these events took place around this time of year, August-Christmas. And now I've began having feelings like it's happening all over again. I guess they're flashbacks maybe? A certain smell will have me in tears, or a song. I can't even use certain shampoos I used back then because they remind me too much. I remember how bad I felt over the holidays for the last 2 years and now I hate them. I hate Christmas music I hate decorations I hate anything that reminds me of how I felt. I literally feel like I'm losing it and cracking up. It's not even so much being raped anymore, it's how I was treated by the courts and how awful I felt. I remember wanting nothing more than to die. I feel almost like I'm living in the moment all over again even though I know it's over. Plus I start class Monday and I feel like maybe that's triggering this too since all this stuff happened at a school. I can't enjoy my life. I barely have friends. I just want to sleep and forget everything, I can't go on like this anymore",
      "Sorry you're going through this, and also that your post was not answered earlier.   The trauma forum sometimes has not a lot of activity compared to the assault forum. I think I understand what you're feeling, and you are absolutely not crazy, in fact what you feel is common and not unexpected, given what happened to you..  There is obviously trauma associated from the assault, but that can be assigned to the one assailant, whom you have the power to avoid and thus reduce the possible triggers.  But there is an additional trauma associated with your experiences seeking justice, and in some ways that is worse because it involves the justice system and society in general.  Far more difficult to live your life in that case, because you can't really avoid society, and to not be believed or be dismissed like you were, is very devastating to your faith in the world.  It does a lot of damage and the symptoms of that are just as you describe, everything reminds you of it and you don't feel that things will go well or work out, you just want to withdraw. You have to resist those urges though, and realize that the world can be a good place where you can be happy again.  From your description of the guy's life, it's very clear that he is a dufus and a serial offender, and you were telling the truth from the beginning.  So you have to take comfort in the knowledge that he is proving you right with everything he does, even though it didn't help your case. Then you have to recognize that not everyone is like that, but you can't have good experiences unless you get out there and allow yourself to have them.  I know that's really hard when you feel triggered by so many things, but you have to make good memories to replace the bad ones, that's a big part of how you heal. In dealing with the things that trigger you, there are PTSD grounding techniques that you might look into that would help.  I don't know if you've ever had professional or adequate care after your assault, but if you're at school, they should have counseling resources available to you .  They can help with the triggering and PTSD as well.  I think it wouldn't hurt to have that support system in place, and someone to talk to, while getting back into the school environment again.. You mentioned that you started school this week, I hope that went well and I think it's terrific that you're continuing with your education and your life.  It's hard but it's also exactly what you should be doing.  If you don't yet feel comfortable with personal relationships, you can still do things in a group setting, and college is an ideal place for that, with so many people around that will share your interests. Main thing is, don't give up or give in.  You did nothing wrong and should not be the one who is suffering.  If you start feeling down, are triggered or have flashbacks, talk to someone about it, your counselor or your friends, you don't have to deal with it alone.  You had a bad experience with the courts, but not everyone will be like that, I think most people hearing your story would be sympathetic and empathetic. I really hope you will, and that things go well for you this semester.  You can post back here at any time as well, there are some really good people here that will help.  And please remember to take care of yourself, you are what's most important!"

      "Nice question. I think the answer is going to vary for all of us..  but ultimately, I guess I can call myself recovered when my symptoms are reduced to a level low enough to enable me to go out and about, form relationships, sleep..  laugh.

This passage from Wikipedia is a good description of my cognitive issues during my teens and early 20s: \"difficulty regulating attention, problems with a variety of 'executive functions' such as planning, judgement, initiation, use of materials, and self-monitoring, difficulty processing new information, difficulty focusing and completing tasks, poor object constancy, problems with 'cause-effect' thinking, and language developmental problems such as a gap between receptive and expressive communication abilities.\" More generally,  my symptoms were mild dissociation (daydreaming), emotional instability (roller-coaster), somatization (I always hurt somewhere), hypervigilance, anxiety, lack of self-esteem ... Nowadays, I'm mildly anxious with short-lived peaks of stress. Half the time I'm relaxed which is something I'm new to. I feel internally repaired but I haven't found my place in the world.

Would have been the same if I had ever done team sports. Was not comfortable in cubs (mini scouts). As an employee I did good work, actually very good, but always had issues with other staff and the boss. I did not trust anyone. I actually thought they were all stupid and naive to trust anyone. I also did not want anyone. I partnered up basically as I was trying to fit in and not be weird. I had a fear of being \"that weird old guy who lives alone\".

It gives me insight, but not much else. One of my things was and my children have picked it up. I always tried to be the guy in the background. The person people could not remember. I dressed for it, and acted that way. I was proud that I could spend an evening at a party talk and mingle and no one would know a thing about me when I left. (people love talking about themselves).

      "Saw the Ame Deal verdict (big trigger if you google the case) and we had three things in common. Small things but very unusual in the cases I have seen. Had not come across one of them before. The aunt has been given the death sentence. Land mark decision. Thirty years ago she may have walked. I thought I was fine, but those three things rattled around in my head. When I got home I was upbeat (my wife gets upset if this stuff brings me down - she was in an abusive house but hides from it, so we never talk about it) When I went to bed I could not get to sleep. I was very tired but every little noise by my son who has moved back with us kept me awake. I noticed my pulse was up, breathing up, yep, I was right back to how I was as a teen. I was on the edge of fight or flight . When all lights were out after about maybe 30 minutes, I relaxed and  I drifted off. I realized that this was exactly how I had lived for decades. Looking back I don't know how I have done what I have done. I was so happy with myself that I had beaten this crap. Will be an interesting couple of days.",

      "Thanks, Sea appreciated. Avartar nailed it. This was bad but I recognized it for what it was. I did not sleep any better, but I was more rational. I momentarily contemplated going to a hotel with a door that I could double lock, so I could sleep better. Sounds insane but that was my mental state. Climb out of bed, get dressed. Drive round until I found a hotel with a vacancy - check the locks and then sleep. Sounded rational in my mind. Luckily I did not, but I may have actually slept better. It would have upset my wife enormously. I was very tired yesterday, I let the work slide and will catch up. Right now I feel okay but very emotionally drained. Recognising it for what it is lets you deal with it. The issue had always been growing up and for so many of us, that we don't know it is an issue. We are just different.

      "I'll break the ice. I'm feeling like crap, I've had some physical sensations I don't like and I have extreme medical anxiety and avoidance.  I'm not sure where the line is between other forms of anxiety, OCD, etc., but from a very young age I would glom onto a random description of disease and obsessively think about getting it, no matter how outlandish.  And whenever I have symptoms, I suspect the absolute worst.  I have been good about not checking online, I guess that's good.... otoh if it could be really minor, I'm missing out on relaxing a tiny bit, otoh I'd find the worst thing and make it so in my head.  So.... I'm dying (in my mind, at the least).  Meh.  I have to go get it seen to eventually, I know.  I keep procrastinating out of, well, terror comes close to how I feel about it.  I'm so miserable, both physically and emotionally, that I'm actually thinking of therapy, something I never would have, before, but I'm getting too old to ignore stuff and hide from Drs. Note I talk a good game.  What I do remains to be seen. Other forms of OCD,  well, not too bad. I've not been overchecking everything lately, not even at work.  Okay, rechecking just a little.  But it's been a while since I've had to turn around and go back upstairs like, a bunch of times just to check that faucet.  So that's good. I've been throwing stuff away today of my mom's.  She saved EVERYTHING.  A lot of personal stuff I schlepped to my house when she passed, and now I'm trying to let some of it go.  Old photos of her third husband from when he was with his first wife, old Xmas decorations I got in grade school, a lock of my first cat's fur (I let that out outside, not putting her in a garbage can!), stuff like that.  I tried to throw away my mom and mine's hospital bracelets (yes, I have my baby ankle bracelet.  she threw away noth. ing.)  and couldn't, but still I'm making progress in getting a de-hoardish attitude.  The Mancave may actually be welcoming someday!  Even the s/o was surprised, she was supportive and did not pressure me to throw anything away and even questioned my choices, but what do I ever do with anything?  I can't make love to the stuff.  Needs to go. My intrusive thought OCD, well harm OCD, to be specific, hasn't bothered me too much lately.  Most of the time that stays beat down by logic, but every now and then it manages to break thru the haze and make me at least uneasy.  But not usually panicked, I've lived with that for a very long time now, and can usually manage to keep it firmly in its place.  Just steer into the wind and let them blow past..... I think that's the full initial how I'm feeling.... I suppose that's a little in the way of introduction, too, since I've not posted much here.",
      "Today I am doing really well. Instead of trying to fight and defeat the monster of obsessions with which I am faced, I am simply walking away - which is the easiest and best possible solution to overcome any OCD symptom. I've realized today after wandering around my garden and audibly talking to myself like a crazy person (my neighbors probably think I'm really disturbed, but it's my method of thinking. I organize what I think by uttering my thoughts audibly)  that the biggest battle an OCD sufferer faces is not having to prove that they are NOT something, but to prove their identity. For example, I have dealt with homosexual OCD and pedophile OCD multiple times in my life. At the time of my disturbance, I was mistaking these doubts as \"you ARE a pedo / homo.\" By framing the doubt in the form of a statement of affirmation, then that is either the trick of extreme OCD or it could be the result of one's true identity. However, in most cases of OCD the statement of doubt is rather a negation, such as \"You are NOT heterosexual / attracted to adults.\" In the first affirming statement, one could easily say \"No I am not\" and that would be the end of that; or they could say \"maybe I am\" and they would follow into a process of self discovery that would present it's own series of challenges that are much different than OCD. In the second negation statement, one has to battle tirelessly to prove \"Yes I am.\" And that's where the obsessive-compulsive battle begins. This statement of doubt is one that directly challenges the established structure of identity that has been conditioned and sculpted over the span of one's entire life, which causes the ruminating thoughts because one is forced to review their entire life's span. But instead of even trying to engage in this battle of wit and will between my own consciousness and identity, and the mischievous devil of OCD, I'm just growing sick of it and walking away. There's no point in arguing with an irrational monster that only exists in your head - just as there's no point in arguing with fools in real life. Other than that, there's a woman... I swear her body is the manifest of my dreams. Curves for days, rose-red lips and brown eyes, thick brunette hair and skin so creamy that you can pour it into a glass and drink. She's coming over tomorrow, and I can't wait to have my wicked way with her. On top of that, my new care team that is helping me recover from OCD and other disabilities is very comprehensive and persistent. Today alone, I received 3 phone calls from my clinic that were all discussing with me referrals to sleep studies and neurologists, as well as trying to push my new medication through so that my insurance will cover it. Tomorrow, I see this ethereal woman... then I get to see another equally extraordinary woman later that night. What can I say? I'm not in a relationship, and I make my intentions known and clear. I never lie about what I want nor hide it, but somehow that just keeps them coming back for more. Maybe I've really become the devil I thought I was? Either way, where there is fire, I carry gasoline.",
      "lol honesty is the best policy.... have a good evening! Re: sounding like a crazy person- I stopped stressing talking to myself a long time ago.  Someone asks me who I'm talking to, I just tell them, 'myself' and look at them like it's perfectly normal.  Supposed to be a sign of intelligence anyway.  Not that I am, but they don't have to know that.",
      "It's lunch time now and I'm feeling ok I guess. I've had a lot of reassurance today though so it's not like I'm making progress. Sometimes the obsessive thoughts come and I compulsion before I even have a chance to catch it. Sometimes o get obsessive thoughts that are so broad I can't even think of a compulsion that will calm myself. Does that happen to others? Also, thank you for the encouragement my thread otter. It helps a little. The doubt is still crushing and terrifying but I have to hope I will get back to being recoveredish.",
      "Broad obsessions happen to me all the time. Sometimes when I'm acting compulsively, the original obsession is just gone entirely but compulsion still has it's shackles on me. It's almost like an alcoholic who starts drinking because of a broken marriage. After a certain time passes, the broken marriage no longer becomes relevant to how much he drinks, but he drinks himself stupid anyway. That's actually pretty common with OCD.",
      "Since this Is also about things that spike people. I need to say this. I'm terrified of going in for treatment with a new therapist because this ocd isnt one of the ones that is under the sexual themes or any themes on just about every website, yet there are quite a few of us on this forum. What gives?",
      "I'm not sure exactly what you are saying Ashes? Are you saying that you have some sort of OCD going on which doesn't seem to be addressed in other place, or the kind other people have had?",
      "Let me clarify my worry. TOCD is not ever mentioned in articles describing the various types of OCD on the many websites discussing ocd. This increases the amount of anxiety generated by the \" this ocd doesnt even exist, you are having very real gender worries. you had ocd but this isnt it. It was the hocd, the health fears, the existential fears, but its not this.\" Do I make any more sense? I apologize for my writing. it is very painful even typing some of this.",

      "Hello, I'm a fellow Pure-O sufferer and I've suffered from it since I was 11 years old (I'm 25 now). I've been reading this forum for the past couple of weeks, and I find myself kind of repeating a lot of information to people who are new to this illness and feel lost. I figured I'd make a thread which encompasses all of the information I know in one place and hopefully it will help people. Why do I have these obsessive thoughts? There's still a bit of debate on the absolute exact part of the brain which causes OCD, however, scientists have recently discovered that it probably has something to do with the immune system . What is almost universally agreed in is there's a part of your brain which controls the flight-or-fight response which is misfiring. Instead of warning you about an impending lion attack or a noise in the dark, your brain has incorrectly attached this primal level of anxiety to a particular thought or question. Why won't they go away? What do I do? The thoughts don't go away because you unwittingly legitimize them! (From OCDOnline.com ) It's important to first of all note that YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE THOUGHTS YOU HAVE OR HOW MUCH ANXIETY A SPIKE CAUSES DIRECTLY. But you CAN influence it over time. The response which is only natural is to try and neutralize the fear and escape it. For example, the instinctive response would be to: -Google information about illnesses to confirm that you don't have them. -Obsessively evaluate your level of arousal to determine if you're gay. -Avoid anxiety triggers which cause you to have scary thoughts. -Obsessively 'problem solve' to try and find an answer to an ambiguous question. The problem is every time you engage in the instinctual response, you've alleviated your anxiety at the cost of legitimizing the fear you're experiencing. You've sent a very clear message to your brain that this particular thought is a legitimate threat, and to watch out for it in the future. So how should you respond, then? The therapeutic response is also known as the 'extinction response'. Rather than trying to escape these thoughts, you accept them and you choose to live with the ambiguity. You allow them a place in your mind, and you allow yourself to feel the anxiety they bring. You're not giving in, and you're not going to try and get rid of the thoughts. By being accepting to your anxiety and these scary thoughts, you're telling your brain that they're not important. Over time, the thoughts and anxiety gradually drop off! The most effective way to utilize this technique is something called exposure and response prevention therapy. You are intentionally exposed to your fears based on a hierarchy, and you endure them until your anxiety level goes down. As the therapy continues, you move up the hierarchy until you finish the list you've created. How do I know if this is OCD or a legitimate fear? How can I be certain? What I'm really losing it? Dr. Steven Phillipson says it best in this case. Paraphrasing: \" If you don't know if it's OCD, it is. Treat it as such .\" It's only natural with OCD to have constant doubts about your thoughts, including whether or not your thoughts are part of OCD, and it's important to note just how comprehensively deceptive and frightening OCD can be. You can feel emotions, sensations, and have thoughts which are terrifying and out of place, which is why it's only natural to try and escape them. I almost a-liken it to a dream-state; while you're in the dream, things which are completely bizarre and illogical seem very real until you wake-up. Someone who has contamination OCD is experiencing the profound sense and terror of being surrounded by dangerous germs, while a person not engaged in this obsession virtually no such fear and regards it as silly and irrational. A contamination OC knows on some level that their fear is not something rooted in reality, but they don't feel it like someone who doesn't share this obsession. Why am I worrying about such morbid things? There must be something wrong with me! The particular obsession in OCD has no bearing on who you are as a person, and has no clinical significance. It doesn't matter if you're worried about harming people, germs, or sexuality, the methodology if treating the disorder is exactly the same, and no clinical significance (to my knowledge) has ever been found correlating with a particular OCD obsession. It's really a waste of time trying to find the root of the obsession, and doing so really isn't therapeutically useful. Your main goal shouldn't be \"how did I get here?\" but rather \"how do I get rid of this?\" I've personally had obsessions that run the entire gamut. I think that if I just find the right answer, I can shut this obsession and fear off permanently! I'd like to share a story which illustrates why this isn't the case. When I was 11, I was watching Jerry Springer on TV late at night while trying to fall asleep and I had the sudden thought of \"I'm gay\". This triggered a very sudden and profound sense of terror. I got up and bolted out of my room and into the bathroom where I had a major panic attack. I had no idea, but this would be the start of HOCD for me. \"Why can't I get rid of these thoughts? Why can't I stop thinking about this?\" Every time I 'solved' an anxious thought in my mind, another one would pop up 10 minutes later. This kept going for months, and I was deeply unhappy and terrified. I had no idea what OCD was, and neither did my parents. They called me a worrier (or affectionately, a worry-wart) and told me not to stop wasting my time. They bought me a book bout puberty detailing how homosexual thoughts at a young age were totally natural, and I would go and read that page of the book perhaps 20 times a day as an escape response. There seemed to be absolutely no end in site, and my parents decided to come up with a crafted lie. They told me that when I was born, they had a special chromosome test done which identifies if the child is going to grow up gay or not and mine came back negative. I was elated! I finally had my perfect answer. I could finally relax... For a day. The fear came back, which made no sense! I had my perfect answer and this fear was still going on?! How can this be?! It didn't matter, and I worried for another month or so. Eventually, my fears morphed. I started worrying about bizarre things such as if my mother was a hermaphrodite or that I was going to contract rabies or get a brain-tumor. As an adult now who's experienced with OCD and knows how it functions, it makes total sense. The reason the answer my parents gave me didn't shut the OCD off was that it's impossible to give OCD a perfect answer, because OCD is by its very nature illogical. It will bend and contort in ways which don't play by the rules to perpetuate the obsession, and using stone-cold logic is frankly a waste of time for any long-term relief. The only way to win is to not play its game. Would talk-therapy help me through my OCD? The short answer is no, because talk-therapy is an attempt to reason with something which is inherently unreasonable. Historically it's been pretty ineffective at treating OCD, because the person doesn't need convincing that the fear is irrational. Though plagued with doubt, OCs know that their fear is irrational or at least the time spent obsessing is irrational and they'd like to be free of it. Exposure and response prevention therapy from a skilled experienced behavioural therapist is the best way to treat OCD. What are some good resources for OCD? These are my favourite two, and they're both from the same person. To give you an idea of how prolific this guy is in the world of OCD, he invented the word 'spike' and has really been the one to pioneer the major treatment for Pure-O OCD. 2 HOUR VIDEO SERIES ABOUT PURE-O OCD (and OCD in general) FROM DR. STEVEN PHILLIPSON: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhVp4g742kM LIST OF OCD ARTICLES FROM DR. STEVEN PHILLIPSON: http://www.ocdonline.com/articlesphillipson.php Any Advice? -Don't suffer alone . Tell someone close to you about your illness, and if you're comfortable, tell them the specific obsessions you have. Having someone know exactly what you're going through has helped me immensely in my experience. Try to educate those close to you about OCD and show them videos and articles. -YOU CAN ENDURE THE ANXIETY, AND IT WILL GO AWAY ON ITS OWN WITHOUT THE ESCAPE RESPONSE. The moment you realize that you don't have to do what OCD tells you, you're going to gain a new sense of freedom.

      "Ada wrote: Wince, could you perhaps say something about what spikes are?  I was thinking about this and realised I'm not clear myself.  And they're mentioned a couple of times above. Sure. A spike is essentially an intrusive thought. It's very important to note that not just OCs get spikes! Everyone experiences them, but the way they're handled is profoundly different. For example, someone standing on a train platform will commonly have a thought such as \"Jump in front of the train.\" The difference between an OC and a non-OC is made after the spike itself. Non-OC: Neutral response. Perhaps thinks the thought is strange, but sees it as insignificant. OC: Brain miss-fire creates a sense of profound anxiety and terror, causing the person to question why they would have such a thought and what it says about them as a person. The OC's response to the spike is not due to faulty reasoning, but simply is a reaction to the anxiety they're experiencing. They think something is wrong with them because their brain is telling them that something is wrong by triggering the flight or fight response. By doing what's only natural, which is to try and neutralize the thought and escape the anxiety, the person has unfortunately reinforced it. This is pretty much how obsessions are born. The message to the brain has been sent that this fear is legitimate. One of the most important aspects of treating OCD is convincing the sufferer that having thoughts, even ones which most people consider \"bad\", are not harmful or an indication of who they are as a person. Thoughts are simply the mind's way of relating information based on context. It's giving you potential options of things you could do, not things you'd want to do. Our subconscious generates loads of stupid ideas and useless crap and it's up to our conscious mind to sift through it and pick the ones which are worthwhile. By being accepting that you can't control the thoughts you have, and instead accepting randomness of your the mind coupled with the decision to accept anxiety and making the choice to endure it rather than escape from it, you can really battle OCD and gain control of your life.",
      "Thanks for this thread, there is some great information here",
      "Your feelings towards the disease seem sound, apart from \"Why do I have these obsessive thoughts?\" - as a scientist and fellow suffer I found this quite lacking. OCD is ultimately an irrational disease - maybe perfect clarity of it's epidemiology causes over time or maybe they won't - but what is important to understand is that as you point out it is responsive. Other than that, I'd suggest this topic be stickied it's a very useful reference for people who feel like they are lost to OCD."

      "Definition Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a potentially disabling anxiety disorder. The person afflicted with OCD becomes trapped in a pattern of repetitive senseless thoughts and behaviors that are very difficult to overcome. A person's level of OCD can be anywhere from mild to severe, but if severe and left untreated, it can destroy a person's capacity to function at work, at school or even to lead a comfortable existence in the home. For many years, mental health professionals thought of OCD as a rare disease because only a small minority of their patients admitted to having the condition. The disorder often went unrecognized because many of those afflicted with OCD, ashamed of their repetitive thoughts and behaviors, failed to seek treatment. This led to underestimates of the number of people with the illness. However, a survey conducted in the early 1980s by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) provided new knowledge about the prevalence of OCD. The NIMH survey showed that OCD affects more than 2 percent of the population, meaning that OCD is more common than such severe mental illnesses as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or panic disorder. OCD strikes people of all ethnic groups. Males and females are equally affected. Although OCD symptoms typically begin during the teen years or early adulthood, research shows that some children may even develop the illness during preschool. Studies indicate that at least one-third of cases of adult OCD began in childhood. Suffering from OCD during early stages of a child's development can cause severe problems for the child. It is important that the child receive evaluation and treatment as soon as possible to prevent the child from missing important opportunities because of this disorder. Symptoms Obsessions Unwanted repetitive ideas or impulses frequently well up in the mind of the person with OCD. Persistent paranoid fears, an unreasonable concern with becoming contaminated or an excessive need to do things perfectly, are common. Again and again, the individual experiences a disturbing thought, such as, \"This bowl is not clean enough. I must keep washing it.\" \"I may have left the door unlocked.\" Or \"I know I forgot to put a stamp on that letter.\" These thoughts are intrusive, unpleasant and produce a high degree of anxiety. Compulsions In response to their obsessions, most people with OCD resort to repetitive behaviors called compulsions. The most common of these are checking and washing. Other compulsive behaviors include repeating, hoarding, rearranging, counting (often while performing another compulsive action such as lock-checking). Mentally repeating phrases, checking or list making are also common. These behaviors generally are intended to ward off harm to the person with OCD or others. Some people with OCD have regimented rituals: Performing things the same way each time may give the person with OCD some relief from anxiety, but it is only temporary. People with OCD show a range of insight into the uselessness of their obsessions. They can sometimes recognize that their obsessions and compulsions are unrealistic. At other times they may be unsure about their fears or even believe strongly in their validity. Most people with OCD struggle to banish their unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Many are able to keep their obsessive-compulsive symptoms under control during the hours when they are engaged at school or work. But over time, resistance may weaken, and when this happens, OCD may become so severe that time-consuming rituals take over the sufferers' lives and make it impossible for them to have lives outside the home. OCD tends to last for years, even decades. The symptoms may become less severe from time to time, and there may be long intervals when the symptoms are mild, but for most individuals with OCD, the symptoms are chronic. Causes The old belief that OCD was the result of life experiences has become less valid with the growing focus on biological factors. The fact that OCD patients respond well to specific medications that affect the neurotransmitter serotonin suggests the disorder has a neurobiological basis. For that reason, OCD is no longer attributed only to attitudes a patient learned in childhood -- inordinate emphasis on cleanliness, or a belief that certain thoughts are dangerous or unacceptable. The search for causes now focuses on the interaction of neurobiological factors and environmental influences, as well as cognitive processes. OCD is sometimes accompanied by depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, a personality disorder, attention deficit disorder or another of the anxiety disorders. Coexisting disorders can make OCD more difficult both to diagnose and to treat. Symptoms of OCD are seen in association with some other neurological disorders. There is an increased rate of OCD in people with Tourette's syndrome, an illness characterized by involuntary movements and vocalizations. Investigators are currently studying the hypothesis that a genetic relationship exists between OCD and the tic disorders. Other illnesses that may be linked to OCD are trichotillomania (the repeated urge to pull out scalp hair, eyelashes, eyebrows or other body hair), body dysmorphic disorder (excessive preoccupation with imaginary or exaggerated defects in appearance) and hypochondriasis (the fear of having -- despite medical evaluation and reassurance -- a serious disease). Researchers are investigating the place of OCD within a spectrum of disorders that may share certain biological or psychological bases. It is currently unknown how closely related OCD is to other disorders such as trichotillomainia, body dysmorphic disorder and hypochondriasis. There are also theories about OCD linking it to the interaction between behavior and the environment, which are not incompatible with biological explanations. A person with OCD has obsessive and compulsive behaviors that are extreme enough to interfere with everyday life. People with OCD should not be confused with a much larger group of people sometimes called \"compulsive\" for being perfectionists and highly organized. This type of \"compulsiveness\" often serves a valuable purpose, contributing to a person's self-esteem and success on the job. In that respect, it differs from the life-wrecking obsessions and rituals of the person with OCD. Treatment Clinical and animal research sponsored by NIMH and other scientific organizations has provided information leading to both pharmacological and behavioral treatments that can benefit the person with OCD. One patient may benefit significantly from behavior therapy, yet another will benefit from pharmacotherapy. And others may benefit best from both. Others may begin with medication to gain control over their symptoms and then continue with behavior therapy. Which therapy to use should be decided by the individual patient in consultation with his or her therapist. Medication Clinical trials in recent years have shown that drugs that affect the neurotransmitter serotonin can significantly decrease the symptoms of OCD. The first of these serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SRIs) specifically approved for the use in the treatment of OCD was the tricyclic anti-depressant clomipramine (Anafranil). It was followed by other SRIs that are called \"selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors\" (SSRIs). Those that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of OCD are flouxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox) and paroxetine (Paxil). Another that has been studied in controlled clinical trials is sertraline (Zoloft). Large studies have shown that more than three-quarters of patients are helped by these medications at least a little. And in more than half of patients, medications relieve symptoms of OCD by diminishing the frequency and intensity of the obsessions and compulsions. Improvement usually takes at least three weeks or longer. If a patient does not respond well to one of these medications, or has unacceptable side effects, another SRI may give a better response. For patients who are only partially responsive to these medications, research is being conducted on the use of an SRI as the primary medication and one of a variety of medications as an additional drug (an augmenter). Medications are of help in controlling the symptoms of OCD, but often, if the medication is discontinued, relapse will follow. Behavior Therapy Traditional psychotherapy, aimed at helping the patient develop insight into his or her problem, is generally not helpful for OCD. However, a specific behavior therapy approach called \"exposure and response prevention\" is effective for many people with OCD. In this approach, the patient deliberately and voluntarily confronts the feared object or idea, either directly or by imagination. At the same time the patient is strongly encouraged to refrain from ritualizing, with support and structure provided by the therapist, and possibly by others whom the patient recruits for assistance. For example, a compulsive hand washer may be encouraged to touch an object believed to be contaminated, and then urged to avoid washing for several hours until the anxiety provoked has greatly decreased. Treatment then proceeds on a step-by-step basis, guided by the patient's ability to tolerate the anxiety and control the rituals. As treatment progresses, most patients gradually experience less anxiety from the obsessive thoughts and are able to resist the compulsive urges. Studies of behavior therapy for OCD find it to be a successful treatment for the majority of patients who complete it, and the positive effects endure once treatment has ended, if there are follow-up sessions and other relapse-prevention components. According to studies, more than 300 OCD patients who were treated by exposure and response prevention, an average of 76 percent showed lasting results from 3 months to 6 years after treatment. One study provides new evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy may prove an effective aid for those with OCD. This variant of behavior therapy emphasizes changing the OCD sufferer's beliefs and thinking patterns. Further studies are required before cognitive-behavioral therapy can be adequately evaluated. Self-Care and Family Support People with OCD will do best if they attend therapy, take all prescribed medications, seek support of family, friends, and a discussion group. When a family member suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder it's helpful to be patient about their progress and acknowledge any successes, no matter how small.",

      "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder that is characterized by recurrent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions), that produce a sense of dread or alarm. Persons then engage in repetitive behaviors (compulsions) in an attempt to rid themselves of the obsessive thoughts and calm the anxiety. The problem is that the relief brought about by the compulsions is temporary, and the obsessions and anxiety always return. If you suffer from OCD you know what it's like to be trapped in a vicious cycle of obsessions - compulsions - relief- obsessions etc. OBSESSIONS are: 1) Thoughts, impulses or images that are distressing and anxiety provoking 2) Intrusive and persistent 3) Often personally repugnant and occur against one's will COMPULSIONS are: 1) Conscious behaviors or rituals that are done to alleviate the anxiety caused by the obsessions 2) Carried out even though the person is aware that the behaviors are senseless or excessive OCD is the fourth most common neuropsychiatric illness in the United States, with as many as 6 million people afflicted. OCD is classed in the family of anxiety disorders, as sufferers experience severe anxiety along with the obsessive thoughts. Anxiety disorders are prolonged exaggerations of our normal reaction to fearful or stressful events, and include panic disorder, phobias, social anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and obsessive compulsive disorder.",
      "Re:garding OCD being persistent unwanted thoughts. Can anyone here offer some advice re: possible OCD. My son's personality changed dramatically following a grade 5 Bullying incident. In hindsight, he experienced all the symptoms of PTSD.  Following the bullying, he became extremely agitated, withdrawn and immediately began to project his rage onto Mommy who he otherwise loved.  This child sealed over but continued to medicate with anger toward mommy. Mommy began to seek outside help for her sons anger. Son had major AVOIDANCE issues relating to the incident and did not want to re-visit the bullying experience in any ways related but continued to project hostilities onto mommy. These hostilities caused him to distance himself from the mother he otherwise loved, resent the mother he loved because mommy was now invested in seeking help for these symptoms and his agenda was to AVOID at all cost. It turned into a situation where mommy was trying to drag the horse to water and make him drink. This anger needed a solution and resolution. This child clearly needed healing. Over time, son tried to rationalize his irrational, illogical, unreasonable resentment and contempt toward mother by rationalizing it as:  \"I hate my mother BECAUSE\": This \"I hate my mother BECAUSE became obsessive\" and found it's way into every conversation and every relationship. Because BECAUSE had NO cause,  peer pressure to explain cause, caused my son to create reason. This scenario was setting mommy up for parent abuse....Bullying, Family Mobbing, Scapegoating There is no doubt that PTSD is a factor because of the need for AVOIDANCE to all things related to the school and people related to the people including avoidance of the mother who became the first link on the Chain of Associations. However, can this be OCD in addition to PTSD. There is no reasonable, rational, logical explanation why son Hates Mother. The BECAUSE goal post over the years keeps moving and shifting.  The real reason still remains:  AVOIDANCE of discussing core issue: Mommy who is related to core issue, is still trying to bring this horse to water and making attempts to resolve the abuse she now suffers due to son's irrational, illogical and un-reasonable unexplained Hate of Mother. We clearly have a problem. Today son is a single father of 2 and now unemployable due to the trauma burden. He still HATES mommy and has now estranged himself from both parents since dad now got added to the Chain of Associations. His children have been up to this point home schooled (the real reason is still AVOIDANCE) of memories associated with the school bullying. He is further and further isolating himself, today all his old friends have pushed away from him, his ex has a new life and he subsists partly from disability pension and partly from his children's allowance. He struggles with severe depression. Today, two little boys are the real victims of their father's disorder. We're now going for \"grandparents rights\" $$$$$ despite hefty legal fees. Son and co-dependent ex are fighting us tooth and nail. The reason BECAUSE:    \"The Sharing of False Concerns\" We won't talk about how Mommy the \"Scapegoat\" is faring.  Mommy finally had to move far away, deep into the wilderness to AVOID the slander and vicious smear campaigns aimed at her by dysfunctional, disordered family members, also to avoid becoming as insane as the rest of the family embroiled in this co-dependency. This Arch Bully (son) is the now called \"Poor Me\" and Mommy the Victim is now known as \"Perpetrator\". Welcome to the family of PTSD Mother of 2",

      "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is probably the most difficult to know of many health issues. Persons who have this condition are repeating selected behaviors or even thoughts again and again and again. Symptoms of OCD: 1. Washers fear so much contamination. They often have clean-up or hand-washing compulsions. 2. Checkers consistently check issues them to associate with harm or maybe danger. 3. Doubters and sinners are frightened that when everything isn’t best or done perfect something terrible will occur or they'll be punished. 4. Counters and arrangers are enthusiastic about order and symmetry. They might have superstitions about certain numbers, colors, or maybe arrangements. 5. Hoarders dread that something bad will occur if many people throw anything away. They compulsively hoard things that they don’t will need."

      "Here are the symptoms of ocd Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder SYMPTOMS Either obsessions or compulsions: Obsessions as defined by (1), (2), (3), and (4): recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress the thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems the person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action the person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind (not imposed from without as in thought insertion) Compulsions as defined by (1) and (2): repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly the behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive --- And: --- At some point during course of the disorder, the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. Note: This does not apply to children. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or usual social activities or relationships. If another disorder is present, the content of the obsessions or compulsions is not restricted to it. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition. resource:http://psychcentral.com/disorders/sx25.htm Here is somemore imfo http://www.healthyplace.com/Communities ... ildren.htm",

But, as a fellow sufferer for those who wonder if they have this... the best explaination is these three things. Obsessive: Let's say that the house, room or such is not clean enough?  So you find yourself constantly making sure it's clean.  But, you really have any concrete idea why?  You just have to have it CLEAN. So the house is clean... and your comfortable... until you see something that shouldn't be there.  Something.  It could be dirt.  Posssibly that... but...IT DOESN\"T belong their.  So sweep it up.  Possibley the neighbors or a family memember comes over.  Can you imagine a neighbor coming and seeing that... saying what nis that... giving you a critical eye...  THAT?  Yet, in actuality, the neighbor doesn't even notice... but the gaze was near it. Obsessive.  Fueled by what others might think. You go to school.  The last thing you want to do is go in the school shower.  Yet the girls tease you.  They always are saying, \"your not good enough,\" because a girl told you... you were dirty... not good enough for the rest.  So, You must wash your hands.  You must take a lot of showers.  You can't help yourself.  You must wash. Wahing hands... taking showers or baths.  Your skin and hair is dried out...I must look ugly, and you know this, but if I am unclean... I must keep doing this... Compulsive... must do something about it... So I must do this stuff... Disorder.  You need help.  You have OCD. Treating it needs professional treatment.  But one of the things you neede is a sensational treat ment that goes backward. OK.  You must wash your hands.  What if don't.  How far can you go without doing it...and what is the outcome?  I must shower.  I am unclean... Stop and see what happens. (What I just said is not for Post Tramatic Stress.  It needs a different approach.)  I can do that...yes, but I am on this topic. The outcome is to make sensations less.  So you can eventually stop or just stop what happens when you feel you really need to do these things. OCD...  IS repetative.  Something over and over.

      "Say that I knew someone who applied a tube of chapstick to their lips every 5-10 minutes. Would that be OCD? Oh, and they've done it for 3 years now.",
      "It's a good possibility.  If she has been putting chapstick on in the manner you have spoke about, it's possible. To find out?  Ask her if she can use the chapstick and put it in your pocket.  say you lips are dry and you're just borrowing it.  Tell her she will give it back after being together. If she get proccupied, as if all she can think about, it's chapstick.  If she won't give it up, that could also be a sign. Using chapstick the way she does could mean she has a ritual.  If take away part of the ritual, then the person anxious  If she isa \"neat freek.\"  If she constantly brushes her hait so many times brfore bed.  Does she check alll outside doors at home exacly 3 times a day. We all hear of the begies, like the lady who washed her hand until they were practically, but a ritual is something a person does, and if not able to do it, anxiety happens.  The action is like a comfort pillow."

      "This has been happening for 3 years now i’m in my early 20s. Idk if I want to say everything but i’ll say what im like today. And the starting point. I was at work and I was on break saw a tiktok of a senior talking to some 11 year olds. I started panicking I started looking at her butt, the person looked “cute”. So now - I feel like it’s all repression. I am overly hypersexual I went to boarding school growing up for the longest time aid just watch porn. I liked adult porn my lonely self had crushes on pornstars I felt inadquate. I wanted an older girlfriend, my sexual problems were so big. Shut I had age appropriate crushes. I think at most 2 years below me. I remember when a 14 yr old girl told someone she liked me and the news reach me I was like ew no wtf. But i remember feeling like i was wanted because i was lonely. I think the only sign of being a pedo would be me watching loli hentai but id watch adult incest like people on my level at the time. I have thoughts and idk why they terrify me so much. I can orgasm to those thoughts, like my brain thinks “tight” and squishy idk if loli contributed to it. Whenever i’m outside. I look at the porn I used to be heavily addicted to and I just can’t even bring myself. There feels like no spike - idk i orgasm when I feel that anxiety. So today, I had to take a family member to swimming I didn’t want to because kids. And there was one girl I saw. and idk what i felt but i felt arousal from her face - i thought i could see that face in an adult but idk really my head is all scrambles. Then I started looking to check (I don’t want to say testing because I don’t want to say I have OCD). And I saw her butt, and I was trying to see if I found it arousing. I was hoping to feel disgust to stop but I didn’t and I started thinking things like sexual stuff. I was so panicky and istg it’s like why am I thinking this in the first place. I went home and watched adult porn and orgasmed but it felt like it was just hiding it. I tested by looking at loli after to see if i liked it. I felt some moments of ew but I felt the arousal feeling again. But it’s like orgasming let my mind rest and stop thinking about it. But i feel guilty that im just chilling. Sometimes my fear is a 16 year old, a 14 year old, 12 year old 8 year old. And these are things that i’ve made up on my mind. I hate going outside at times because of school run when secondary school kids come out of school, and I have a problem with legs and stuff. I think I feel hugely ashamed of viewing children sexually. That normal people can and I can’t. Sometimes I feel like disgusted but I seriously have a sex problem since I was like 8. It’s just now. Idk I keep searching the feelings to see and sometimes I find something. Like I was imagining what if she came onto me would I like this. I’ve spoken to pedophiles and know a lot of terms. Things arouse me, yet I feel like it’s not me. And my brain is mushed. I am deeply terrified to seek help and it’s expensive. It cause sex issues with me and my ex girlfriend and when I told her my thoughts she got upset at me like I didn’t want her. When I went to my doctor they were super mean to me and it’s scared me since. I hate myself, I saw an insta ad of a young girl doing gynmastics. I felt grossed out. But I kept looking to see what it is that I like when I feel aroused and I couldn’t find anything. I feel like a fraud acting as if i have ocd when most people are not like me. I pretty much dropped out of uni for 2 years and rotted wasting my life. But I can orgasm what differentiates me and a pedophile. I just want to open my mind to these thoughts so they stop controlling me. I have so many scenes in my head I don’t feel disgusted anymore just fear and doubt and dread. I’m tired of the mental gymnastics I just want to know even if I was told I’m not a pedo which I doubt why am I the way I am. I’ve lost attraction to people my age. My body feels messed up. I hate that I ask for opinions and even then pedos will also feel disgust and stuff. But I can’t handle it anymore it got better but idk it feels like a spike in anxiety just came. Idk what to do, I don’t watch loli anymore it just idk stopped watching it but I see pornstars that look young and I can finish and if I imagine and adult I feel shame like i’m a pedo I can’t even I don’t even enjoy it anymore. I just stay alone and hide myself then I feel normal when i’m drunk I can feel attraction again it doesn’t feel like me idk anymore. I haven’t done anything please i’m really in distress. I get visions like clip scenes in my head 24/7 and I have to hide this from my friends",
      "You definitely have serious sexual and pedophilia issues, along with anxiety and OCD. You may not be a direct pedophile, but you have traits of it. All toxic.

      "Hi Windwakerlink, I’m so sorry you’re going through all this. My initial impression is that you’re another one of many people suffering from OCD which has manifested itself in POCD. It is a relatively common thing to afflict someone suffering from OCD. The constant checking to see if you’re aroused by it is a very OCD behavior. I suspect you have immense fear if you are a pedophile and this coupled with OCD/anxiety has led you to regularly look for any arousal there. A person with OCD could mentally check if they have arousal over a chair, for example, and find something there -even orgasm over it. The OCD mind can trick you into anything, even believing false memories at times. It’s almost certain that your anxiety is in overdrive and affecting your perception of sexual arousal in this case. I'm confident that if you stopped fearing if you were aroused by this, the thoughts would go away completely in time, and you’d look back years from now and not be able to believe you’d ever questioned that about yourself. The important thing here is that you haven't harmed anyone and have no intentions to ever harm anyone. In fact, the idea of this obviously horrifies you. I think you need to seek help to manage your OCD, ideally from someone who specializes in OCD and can understand it. And through self help books. Many people without knowledge of OCD will find it challenging to understand how you arrived at all this, while someone with experience of it would know this is just typical OCD behavior. OCD is manageable, it will never go away completely but it can be brought from a 10 down to a 1 in severity. I also think deep down you know this is your mind turning on you, which is why you’re posting here. I hope you’re able to build the tools you need to manage OCD and then let all this go and get your life back on track. The more you continue to engage with these checking behaviors or reassuring yourself regarding these thoughts the worse your OCD on the matter will get though. If you ignore them and sit through the terrible anxiety, the fear will lose it’s power in time and the thoughts will become very infrequent.",

      "i posted here recently but my ocd is really messing with me. i know i have ocd. i just don’t know if i have pocd or i just have ocd about actually having real tendencies or something? it’s really distressing me to explain this i’ll start off by saying that i started watching porn when i was 9 or 10. throughout my teenage years i watched so much gross or weird stuff. i think i got off on how taboo it was because some of the stuff i watched i wouldn’t do in real life. one thing that always persisted is that i got off on the idea that people were getting off to things they shouldn’t be. so this escalated to various stuff, like really anything you can imagine. i would fantasize that a guy was getting off on the stuff i was looking at. the issue is that i had and still get turned on by fantasies of men with young girls. i was on youtube one day watching predators get busted on apps because people were pretending to be underage, and the stuff the guy was saying to someone he thought was underage turned me on. i’ve even wanted to go pretend to be underage and find older men online but i never did. i guess i’m worrying if this is bleeding over into real life and if i actually view young girls in a sexualized way. i used to read loli stuff a lot and sometimes i still have. if i was just fantasizing of the guys with them i don’t think i would be freaking out as much, but i know i also got off to things where the girl was naive, she didn’t know what was going on but ended up enjoying it. like i enjoyed innocence being broken? and i also got off on things where they were by themselves and it’s like i liked the idea they were getting off because they weren’t supposed to. like if they were with tentacles, with someone else their age, etc. like sometimes it just focused on the girl. i’m not sure if this is some extension of me liking men with younger girls somehow? is that even what it sounds like? i’m worried about when i read stuff without guys and i got off on other things. i’m mainly freaking out about this because there’s things i’ve done in real life that i remembered and it’s really freaking me out. when i was around 15 or so, my niece was on my back and i was just swinging her around. for some reason i became aware that her private area was on my back and i remember when i was swinging to one side i wondered if she felt anything because of the movement? and i’m worried if after i thought that i purposely swung more aggressively to see if she felt anything. i feel like i remember something like that but i can’t be sure. if i did though, i cant forgive myself because i would have basically acted upon something really gross and disturbing. i’m really scared that was my intent behind it. what if i really swung on purpose to make her feel something? another instance with my niece. this one is recently and these were thoughts i were having when my ocd wasn’t flaring up. she’s going through puberty so things are growing. i remember there were multiple times i was curious what her chest looked like, like what they looked like at that age? i feel like i was curious because of all the stuff i was reading and i feel like it was in a sexualized manner. i remember really wanting to see. one time i was helping her with her hair in the bathtub and i was thinking that stuff again, i didn’t go out of my way to try to see i don’t think and i wouldn’t force her to do that cause that’s gross. she was turned around and i just remember looking down to see if i could see anything. if i’m not attracted to kids why would i be curious what her chest looked like? i’m being serious when i say i was really curious. whenever she was changing clothes it felt like i wanted to accidentally pop in to see if i saw anything. i might be exaggerating with that part but i just don’t know. i’m really scared and i feel like a really bad and gross person. i don’t know what any of this means. i also just remembered when i was like 14 and in deep with all of these fantasies and stuff i imagined her with her dad like once. that’s so gross for me to type. i’m worried i molested her with the stuff i’ve mentioned and that i’m attracted to her. i know people are going to judge me for all of this and you have every right to, i feel gross. i don’t know what to think of anything. is it even possible that any of the scenarios i listed with my niece could be innocent and im overreacting? i don’t think so",
      "I think watching gross and weird stuff online is unfortunately common for our generation. We are the first generation that had to deal with the internet in our teenage years. Look on this forum and you will find many people with similar experiences. It doesn't sound like your niece was harmed in any way. Curiosity is normal for 15 year olds, and at that age we don't have our impulse control fully developed. I am trying to make my piece with the fact that people may judge me. The truth is some people will. But we are imperfect people living in an imperfect world All of this is reassurance, which won't actually help. I know from experience. I think a lot of us here have gone through cycles of posting on here and on reddit. It feels good momentarily, but the real problem is your brain. Right now you are stuck on a cycle. You are ruminating, digging, and trying to \"solve\" something. This cycle will just keep repeating. The key is to break the attempts to \"solve\" it. I'm stealing something I saw in SadKnight's post, tell your brain \"what happened, happened.\" I'm sorry you are going through this, you can get past this!",
      "thank you. it’s just that im scared of ever having acting out on desires or something. especially considering the stuff i’ve watched and the fantasies i had. it’s like im trying to connect the dots. like even if that thing did happen with my niece, i feel like it couldn’t have been an innocent curiosity thing. even if i had innocent or just curious intentions i feel like what i could’ve done is assault or molestation, if i purposely swung her around to make her feel something. and then my ocd connects it to me being a pedophile or corrupt person",
      "OCD will make you conclude the worst possible conclusion about yourself. You can argue with it all day, but OCD isn't rational, and it won't let you win. Everyone on this planet has done weird things they regret. I have had similar fantasies and read similar things. I have accepted that it was a stage of life that I needed to get through to be who I am now. I can't know for sure what it means, or why I was drawn to the things that I was drawn to. it’s just that im scared of ever having acting out on desires I have experienced this too! A really scare truth that I had to make peace with was that I am capable of doing evil things. I can't be 100% sure that one day I won't do something evil, because I believe that everyone on this planet might do something evil in the right circumstances. The best we can do is be thankful that right now, in this point of time, we can do good. OCD wants you to be 100% sure that nothing bad will every happen. But nothing is ever 100%, even if the odds of something bad happening are astronomical.",
      "You need to let this go and stop torturing yourself. If you spend all day looking for any evidence of something terrible in yourself you're going to find it. Everyone would.

      "kittsies wrote: do you really view the things i listed as very small things? i was kinda surprised when i read that because to me they seem like the worst thing in the world right now. Yes, I really do think it's completely something to move on from. Even with your niece it was a passing or intrusive thought you had when you were a kid for a second that didn't amount to anything. It sounds to me like you suffer from intrusive thoughts, not that you're a pedophile. It's easy to tell you're a good person with a conscience. You should be kind to yourself and forgive yourself. kittsies wrote: i do agree that i should lay off the more taboo porn and maybe porn in general because clearly its not helping me at all and it makes me freak out even more. this all started because of the type of porn and fantasies i was having. Everyone has watched pretty extreme porn or gone down that path at some point. So you're not alone here. It's something there should be way more education on. I find in all things in life you have to be careful what you're taking in. If you're constantly taking in extreme porn, or depressing news, or scrolling through videos of people being terrible to one another, or reading incendiary tweets, etc. this stuff affects us in negative ways whether we admit it or not.",
      "don't intrusive thoughts have to be distressing though, and not deliberate? when i imagined my niece with her dad back then, i'm pretty sure it was a fantasy i was having which makes me feel gross now. i'm not sure why i thought that but back then i watched a lot of porn and looking at taboo things made it easier for me to get off. when my niece was on my back i don't really remember feeling grossed out or distressed by the thought. i think it was an actual curiosity thing but it distresses me if i acted on that curiosity and swung her around on purpose to make her feel anything and see if she had another reaction. another thing that bothers me is that i consider myself bisexual (i'm a woman) and throughout my life i've noticed that in porn i'm only attracted to vaginas that have a small labia, is bald, etc. so basically what a prepubescents would look like. and when i looked at the drawn or animated loli stuff, i was attracted to how their genitals looked. i am into ageplay and i got into ddlg way too young when i was 13. when i was 14-15 i romanticized the lolita movie which was stupid of me. i hated turning 20 because i wanted to be 18/19 forever and i've gotten jealous of younger girls solely because of their age, which i know is stupid because i'm only 21. i'm obsessed with looking youthful forever and aging terrifies me. even if i'm somehow not a pedophile, i feel like i'm pretty close to it because i feel like i've sexualized and romanticized being young for so long that i conditioned myself to be turned on by this stuff. like i know i have ocd, i've been diagnosed with it, but it just feels like i have some genuine attraction on top of it. i'm not really sure.",
      "Thinking that intrusive thoughts have to be unpleasant is going to get you stuck. The other day I was driving over a bridge and thought about what it would be like to drive off. I wouldn't describe that intrusive thought as unpleasant. I was curious about what it would feel like, what would happen, how my family would react, but at no point did I have any intention to do it. Intrusive thoughts are usually described as ego-dystonic, meaning against your core beliefs. For intrusive thoughts that don't trigger my OCD, I would describe them as feeling neutral. They just kind of exist in the back of my mind. It seems like you have some stuff you need to work through regarding your sexuality, only because it is obviously causing you some distress. However, right now you are doing the OCD thing of using anything and everything as \"proof.\" Something I had to work on was getting comfortable feeling uncomfortable. The patterns of rumination are in response to discomfort. If you just allow the discomfort to exist, the ruminating will decrease. Basically, the problem isn't the guilt, shame, anxiety, or whatever other negative emotion you are feeling. The problem are the compulsions you are doing in response to those emotions, that's what keeps you stuck. Compulsions lie. They tell you that you can figure it out if you think hard enough. You can't. Your brain won't let you accept whatever answer you come to, so what's the point of ruminating on it?",
      "thanks to everyone who tried to help me. i really appreciate it but i realized i left out a lot of things in my original post that make me seem more innocent than i actually am. i think it’s a lot worse than i described and i’m just going to list why i think i have genuine attraction. - when reading about child abuse stories, i am disturbed but turned on at the same time. i know this is disgusting. i don’t think it’s an extension of my fantasy of guys with younger girls because it could be a woman perpetrator too. i’m not sure if this has happened with stories of children doing stuff with each other but it might have happened, i’m not sure - i have looked at legal porn where the girl looks really young and i am turned on by the size difference with the man. i feel like i’m attracted to the girl’s small body parts but only if she’s with a man? i’m not sure how to describe it. but i’m sure if i ever found videos where if there was a woman with the girl i would’ve gotten turned on too. - this one is really disgusting and disturbing and i’ve felt sick over this for so long. when i was 15, i found these weird videos on youtube of young girls just stretching but it seems like men were uploading these videos? the videos were innocent, but i guess they were suggestive to the men uploading these videos because they were stretching pretty intensely and it was suggestive because the were making weird noises or making faces that could be interpreted as sexual i guess. well i got off to one of these videos a few times, i think i was imagining a guy getting off to the video and giving into his desire. but i feel like i was also getting off to the fact a young girl looked like she was doing something sexual - it seems like my attraction to women is mirrored in my supposed attraction to kids. with regular porn, i can get off to women masturbating. with the animated or drawn stuff, i have gotten off to the young girl masturbating as well. and i think it turns me on more. i don’t know if it’s from the taboo of it or what - this sounds extremely messed up but i was homeschooled so i’ve been on the internet for most of my life. i’m desensitized to a lot of things. i’ve never come across anything illegal but i know myself well enough that if i somehow came across something back then, such as actual abuse or something of a young girl doing things to herself that i could’ve gotten off to it. if it was just a girl by herself, i probably would’ve imagined a guy watching it and giving into his desire and that’s what would’ve gotten me off. but again, i feel like i would’ve also gotten off to the fact it was a young girl doing something sexual. i know this is a very big hypothetical considering it never happened but trust me when i say that teenage me wouldn’t have cared - with the animated/drawn stuff i like it when there’s a bigger guy and even though i get off on that as well, a part of the reason i get off on it is because the girl is enjoying it when she’s not supposed to. but combined with the fact i am attracted to their genitals, it seems like it’s obvious there’s an attraction to kids the thing is, if i was one i could accept it if i never acted on it. then i start obsessing over if i ever did anything inappropriate towards kids. i cannot figure out if i have and i think i’m creating some false memories but i just don’t know. another thing that bothers me is that i cannot for the life of me figure out if i was attracted to my “step niece”. i feel like i had some fantasies of her back then but i can’t pinpoint it so i don’t know if it happened or not? if i did have fantasies of her though there’s absolutely no doubt that i am one, and if i am one there were probably times i acted inappropriate which i just cannot live with. i know the whole point of ocd is that there will never be an answer but i need one. i really am extremely suicidal right now and i don’t know how much longer i can deal with this. telling myself i have POCD is a complete joke because it’s clear i actually am one. idk why i’m even posting this i just needed to tell everyone how messed up i actually am."

      "Can POCD cause false attraction to things like l*li/sh*ta that can lead to orgasm?",
      "Well, if you're testing by masturbating- it's sexual, it's masturbation, you're anxious about it and thinking about it, so... i'm going to say yeah why wouldn't it?  If you're testing, please don't.  Testing is BAD.",
      "I have to agree with Snaga. Whatever is you're thinking while masturbating, you'll get some sort of reaction, but it doesn't say anything about you as a person. Really, you can masturbate to a pan and get a sexual reaction. There's nothing unusual about this. Stop checking your groinal responses.",

      "Hi. I am a 21 year old male who has depression because of POCD that started 13 months ago. Due to my depression, very, very, very few things actually make me happy. One of those things is being apart of the fandom for my favorite game. This information sounds irrelevant right now, but will make more sense later on. Because of POCD, I try to avoid media that have children or teenagers in them. I would spend hours upon hours researching games and anime to find out if they have an adult only cast then make a list of what I can or can't play/watch, just to avoid intrusive thoughts. Over time I learned to care less, realizing that limiting myself in my hobbies is affecting my enjoyment of them, so I stopped researching ages. Monday night (February 10th) I started taking 200mg of Magnesium Glycinate before bed for anxiety. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday were genuinely the happiest I have been since my POCD started. For the last few months my symptoms haven't been as bad, but after starting Magnesium my symptoms were nearly nonexistent, I finally... felt free. I was so, so, so unbelievably happy. On Thursday night I continued playing a game I've been enjoying for the last week or so, then suddenly the player character switches to a 12 year old girl. It was a shock and I didn't expect that in this game at all. Immediately I started having intrusive thoughts, but this time I was aroused by them. I didn't FEEL any anxiety (probably the magnesium), but I wanted the thoughts to be gone, so for some reason, thinking it as a form of exposure, I masturbated to these thoughts. I felt disgusting afterwards, but that feeling eventually went away along with the thoughts and I forgot about it. I didn't even think about it the next morning. The next day, Friday, I woke up with a ton of anxiety. Not about anything in specific, I just felt extremely anxious. Not sure if this has anything to do with it, but before bed on Thursday I actually doubled my dose of Magnesium and took two 200mg capsules at the same time. Anyways, later that day, with my anxiety very high, I saw a normal SFW 3D render on Twitter of my favorite character from my favorite game (adult in her 20s, let's call her G ) that was really good so I went to the artists' account to see more of their work and I saw a very suggestive render using G's younger teenage model. Obviously weirded out by it, I check the replies, curious if anyone else was like \"wtf is this\" (nope lol :D) and the artist was saying other plans they have for renders with that model and the way they were describing them was so creepy. They even stated specifically that they purposefully made the model look even younger than the teenage model already in-game for gross purposes. Usually I'd forget about it, then randomly remember it some other time then start ruminating. I have read people sexualize the teenage version of another character in the game before (let's call her H ) and I always thought those people were weird. This is an example of randomly remembering then ruminating. I would remember this then think things like \"why would people sexualize H's underage version when she's an adult for 99% of the game\" but that's usually the extent I would go. Never gave me any anxiety or anything, just passing thoughts. The difference is I am VERY emotionally attached to G's character. G has a very positive personality which has helped me so much through my depression. A couple of my friends have even related my hyperfixation to autism because of how much I love this game and G , if that tells you how much this is important to me. The POCD problem here is that I had a groinal response when reading the artists' descriptions then looking back at the image. Unlike the night before, this time I had anxiety at these thoughts so I masturbated to them, hoping the anxiety would go away, just like the night before. I was wrong. Ever since then I haven't been able to look at anything related to the game without having extreme anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Whenever I see the adult version of G , which is 99% of the time, all I see is her younger version. It's like my mind just replaced the faces. Seeing all the clips and screenshots and art of this game was one of the only reasons I would get out of bed in the morning. If I was having a bad day I could always count on this game cheering me up. I can't even scroll through Twitter anymore without the fear of seeing something about it. So that's it. The only thing that gave me joy, the thing I've revolved my life around ever since experiencing it, my coping mechanism, my escape, and the thing that saved my life, is now completely ruined for me. I'm not suicidal, but I feel so empty. Like the only thing left of me has died. My heart hurts. It literally feels like it’s trying to rip out of my chest. I’m having a hard time breathing even typing all this. I want to cry but I can’t. I have no energy it's hard for me to move. I can’t sleep. Any time I feel somewhat ok I just reread in my head those descriptive tweets the artist said and I go back to feeling like garbage. I've prayed endlessly for my memory of the last 3 days to just be wiped from my brain. I’m sorry if this paragraph sounds really dramatic, but it's genuine. I guess my question is generally just OCD related and not just specifically POCD, but how can I separate the connections I make with OCD? Unless I figure out how to disconnect this mental experience with the game, I fear I will never be able to enjoy it ever again. Other examples I can think of is I associate the words \"left\" and \"right\" to politics, so I start to have anxiety when I say one of them out loud. Or it's hard to listen to music with lyrics about mental health because I relate them to my life and start ruminating, when before I dealt with depression I thought lyrics like that were corny. An example kinda sorta related to POCD is I've read people sexualizing a literal toddler from an anime and whenever I see that character, those types of people is all I can think about. That same group has also twisted the meaning of an emoji that I use every day, and even though I obviously don't use it for that purpose, I feel anxious using it because of it's \"other purpose.\" Alright. I think that's all I have to say in this post. Sorry that it's so long. I've been wanting to make a post on a website like this detailing what I've experienced with this disorder for the past 13 months but was always terrified by the idea of that, so this is a major accomplishment for me, but I couldn't care less about that, making this post is much more important to me right now. I just hope that putting my thoughts into words helps at least a slight amount, and I hope someone can help me, considering I've spent the last two days typing this all out. I'm afraid by thinking this hard about the situation (1,420 words... sheesh), and by making this post I'm only making it worse, but I just want to be able to enjoy my hyperfixation without it being tarnished by this memory. I'm desperate. Please. I just want to be happy again. I've already lost so much I love to POCD, I cannot lose one of the only reasons why I'm still alive.",
      "Hello, and welcome! I've read your post in as much detail as I can manage for the moment, I'm not in a great headspace myself right now.  But I did want to place a response on your thread, so you feel less alone. So many times people seem to have their OCD spike because of things like games and anime.  Nothing that's ever affected me- as long as real people aren't involved, I've never stressed the age of characters or what I think/don't think about them.  To me, this is all pretty harmless. I say that not to diminish the anxiety you've felt, but to stress that to a lot of people looking at it from the outside, it's exactly that, harmless.  Of course, with OCD we blow everything out of proportion.  I do that with my own OCD fears and themes, so I sympathise.  Once we get to obsessing, it's so hard not to. And I think it's especially hard, when things are even just a little related to sexuality, even if it's just on the surface.  Sexuality is such a fuzzy, ill defined thing, sometimes.  I think something important to remember is that we can't go by thoughts or fantasies or what games we play or what anime we watch, etc., because we are not just those things.  We're also moral beings who live in a real world, and it's rare that someone posts to the OCD forum that even hints at not definitely being the sort of person that would never have a real-world paraphilia for minors.  You have to judge yourself not by the things you've talked about, but by what you really believe, and think, and would do/not do in the real world.  That's how I keep POCD at bay, as well as my harm OCD.  Because I know the real me isn't that sort of person.  In the end, we have to have some faith in ourselves."

      "I'm tired, about what happened in my last post the doubt came back, I've been trying for almost 1 week and 5 days to anakize this and be sure what really happened. You have no idea how bad I feel, I feel a knot in my chest and I just want to disappear. I regret coming here is that I have nowhere to go, I can't lean on family because if they knew what I did, they would be disappointed. Please someone help me, all I want is to know if that such an atrocity: while I was masturbating at the end I used the arousal sensations that the intrusive thought gave me while I was in the back of my mind. I know this just reinforces the cycle of the toc, but I can't live with the anguish of not knowing what really happened. My chest hurts, what do I do? I would be the first person who acted without compulsion in their intrusive thoughts. What can I do? This is too immoral. The only thing I know is that I do not desire sexually or romantically this person, when I see her it is only family love. What do I do? The anguish kills me and I don't know what to do. I already got a psychologist, but I haven't talked about this. I am afraid to know the truth. I will describe what really happened and I am sorry to be explicit, but I want you to know how it really was or what happened objectively. I was therefore in post climax and I was touching myself to intensify the last sensations while I saw a person in the front of my mind (it was not sexual or desire that person, I thought it for I do not know, I just know it was not to fantasize, it is the same person that I use to avoid thought of the intrusive person) and in that comes the intrusive thought that was present in the back of my mind and not very clear and it was not sexual, and as these thoughts give me groinal response or conditioned arousal, I think that while I was observing both thoughts and as the intrusive thought gives me arousal automatically, those sensations came while I was touching myself and I used them to be touching myself or as they came I didn't stop and I followed them and continued using them to intensify the arousal as I did when I was touching myself to intensify the last feelings of post climax. And here comes the doubt: I think that really happened and I used the sensations that the thought provokes and used them to touch me, for pleasure? Acting on my intrusive thoughts and it wasn't compulsion, it was deliberate. I feel like it was that if this happened I was just using the sensations that the thought provoked but I wasn't manipulating the content of the thought or making it sexual, I was just static... you know what I'm saying? It wasn't compulsion, it was deliberate, I acted on them probably. I have analyzed a lot and there is evidence that it didn't happen, but more and more doubts came and more and more doubts came. That it probably wasn't conscious but then it was conscious and I don't know. I will ignore the great analysis that I did. And you can give me your opinion and I can accept that I did the worst and it hurts me but at the same time I don't want to accept because I'm not sure if that happened, but it seems like it did and I don't know, I don't know. Sorry and thank you. I'm just desperate and I have nowhere to go.",

      "Please I would appreciate it if you could give me an answer. I have not seen much about this what happened I How can I move forward? How can I forgive myself? I was in a dream half awake and half asleep, many times I had these dreams, thoughts would come and make me climax and I would squeeze my legs and I would get it, but those times it was me checking my reaction or sometimes they would come without warning, but this time it was different. I couldn't climax, I would squeeze my legs and I really wanted to calm that feeling and release the tension but I couldn't so I reminded myself that those intrusive thoughts make me come right away and I thought them, I decided to think them and I don't know if it was before or after or during I told myself that this doesn't mean anything, that it's just the feelings for the checks that so if I was attracted to them and I trained my body to react to them out of fear and compulsions and that this could happen with another person or thing if the OCD had obsessed over it. But doesn't this make me worse? I saw other cases and a girl also with ocd did that, resorted to intrusive thoughts of mother when she couldn't climax and I read another post where a guy heard a psychologist say that some people use intrusive thoughts or it can happen by accident to climax when they can't climax. And it's like a bubble, the thought is inside the bubble and because of past compulsions (testing) they have attached these feelings of fear or groinal arousal. And it doesn't mean anything about the person. But I can't stop feeling sad and guilty and I’m not attracted to this person( he’s a fam member important to me)  when I see him I don’t feel sexual attraction just family love this is really painful I hate all of this But I can't stop feeling bad. I have analyzed this too many times and I calm down and think I am not alone but I feel sad or something bad happens and I fall back and the guilt comes back and it really hurts me so much. It hurts me to see my family. I don't know what to do. It would be forgivable if it had been a compulsion but it wasn't, I chose to think that thought in order to climax. It was for a second, the image was not even sexual x but the slightest image or idea of that intrusive thought triggers this response in me and I chose that when I was half awake and asleep and climaxed. Please give me an answer. This was not because of the toc it was not compulsion and that makes me feel bad and well I was not the only one who my have done it, still I feel very bad and sad it hurts me a lot and I can't stand it. The guilt doesn't go away and I try to fix it but it keeps coming back. I really want to give up I can’t sleep it’s 1am and I’ve been crying almost all day. I really want to die. I’m even scared of sleeping I don’t want that this happen again but gladly I can manage it is terrible because I don’t want to masturbate half awake/asleep this never happened before all this ocd $#%^. It’s too much I can’t do this anymore I can’t find peace anywhere I can’t rely on anybody because I don’t deserve it I feel terrible a monster I don’t know I just want to die I came here hopefully u can understand me and if not I don’t know I just feel so alone this is the worst I never asked for this and sorry for grammar I never did anything bad why am I going through this I want this to stop",
      "I’m not a psychologist and don’t have OCD but I saw a post that seemed relevant. I hope it’s helpful! catnaps wrote: If you have a fear of being attracted to something, and you have OCD, your mind will invariably bring up those thoughts. It doesn’t confirm at all that you are what you fear, it only confirms that you still fear it. The same is true of where you might glance. If there’s something disgusting right in front of us, many people involuntarily glance at it even though they don’t want to. The important thing here is that you reacted negatively to your eyes briefly checking out your mom and a young girl. You cannot be blamed for a thought that pops into your head you didn’t want or your eyes glancing at something you don’t want to glance at. The more you fear it, the more it’s likely to happen. It’s just the way OCD works.If you trust yourself and ignore those glances or intrusive thoughts, the fear will eventually subside and stop happening. You have said this is an intrusive thought, not a real desire so you should accept it as such. The fact that you have it tied to sexual feelings gives it exaggerated power based on hormones not on reality. It sounds like something to work on not feel guilt. Your brain is telling you lies. You’re not a bad person! I heard someone say when they got intrusive thoughts, instead of being triggered by it they made “friends” with it and would say, “oh, there you are again. I was expecting you. See you later. Bye!” Or something like that. I don’t know of any of this helps but at least you know you’ve been heard and someone cares. Please don’t beat yourself up. You’ve admitted you have a problem. That’s the first step to solving it. One of my favorite quotes is “when you’re going through hell, KEEP GOING!” Wishing you all the best!;",
      "Thank you so so much for your words and time. I appreciate it a lot! But the fact that I decided to think about them like using them to reach climax makes me feel really bad but I guess I have to let it go… the guilt is strong. Thanks for reading me and for your advices. Hope you have a great day/night. Thank you so much",
      "Hello Lesshope! I'm assuming this has something to do with your other thread (which I may choose to merge this one with), concerning intrusive thoughts? Perhaps I missed it, what the intrusive thought was, in that other thread- I'm assuming (because it's terribly common) something of a POCD nature?  Or were they of a HOCD nature?  Not that I'm sure it matters, other than in the small details. And if so, is that what you were thinking while half-asleep? I've woken from dreams, erotic dreams, taboo dreams in which I was the person perpetrating the taboo act.  And, half-asleep, I have been known to ramble along what the dream started, half-awake, half-asleep, sort of fantasizing but half dream-like as well.  To the point of then getting awake enough to masturbate to the thoughts. Which doesn't make me the sort of person that would do what was going on in the dream.  Far from it. Of course, being OCD, it'd be very easy to let it get inside my head and worry about it.  So I both remind myself that I am not necessarily my sexual thoughts; and also I am very careful not to often have the same sort of fantasies or thoughts when wide awake- I can't control what I dream about, that's just too complex a thing and there's never any telling what a dream could mean, or if it means anything at all.  So I try not to stress it, even when it spills into the (half) conscious world.  But I can decide to not fantasize or think things that make me uncomfortable, especially when they're not a core part of my being.  Having said that, however, keep in mind that once you get an OCD-like obsession/worry about something, it's awfully hard not to think it.  It's like having a broken tooth or a sore in your mouth- you keep pestering it and pestering it.  Same thing when a person's gripped in a pretty bad OCD episode, it's just too easy to think about that thing that disturbs you, over and over.  Lord knows enugh people in this forum have done it, repeatedly.  Still doesn't make them whatever it is that was spiking their anxiety.  And doesn't make you a bad person, either.",

These thoughts are not fantasies at all and this just happened once (that I decide to think abt them but these dreams where I’m masturbating I can’t reach climax but the thought appears and it triggers orgasm and The thought Provokes orgasm so I follow it and squeeze my legs together all of this HAPPENS when I’m half awake asleep, just before fully waking up) and I never do it in when I’m awakeI even stopped masturbating because I was scared of the thoughts because they provoke an orgasm or gave me groinal responses, this never happened before I started obsessing with these thoughts about my fam member… and the image (thoughts about a family member) I thought wasn’t even sexual, I only thought about it for 2 or 3 seconds and IIt’s weird because it gives me this feeling of anxiety or arousal that makes me climax… just the idea of the thought triggers an orgasm… when it’s even not sexual! II don’t know, it’s like I trained my brain to react like this, when in the past I used to test myself if I had a reaction to the thoughts of this fam member…How can I stop this connection/reaction? and thanks for your help and time! Hope you have a great day/night!",

      "I wonder that is there anyone here who has experience like ı was experiencing? Yesterday I was watching a video on X. There was a girl who is 8-9 years old. While I was watching this video, suddenly I looked her leg and butt. (Firstly I was listening her and I was looking her face) I think I thought that, I feel a urge and I did. I'm not sure it was intrusive  thing or not. In my opinion it was not. Because right before I didn't feel any disturbance. It kills me... Because I had to be feel bad... I shouldn't look. When this thoughts came to my mind, I should say like \"#######4.\" Actually this theme is not first for me... In the past, I was struggling this theme. Once when I was talking with my mom I looked her leg. Then I felt guilty etc. After that moment I felt anxiety for a while, also I'm experiencing this anxiety. I am asking myself why I did that? In the past I struggled pocd, hocd and false memory ocd. But this context I feel guilty... Because I didn't have intrusive  thoughts in that moment, I'm feeling like I did it willingly... After that my pocd came back. Actually I think everbody can experience this situation in the world. But I don't know. I'm not pedo, I know it. But I feel that I shouldn't look kids's leg etc.",
      "If you have a fear of being attracted to something, and you have OCD, your mind will invariably bring up those thoughts. It doesn’t confirm at all that you are what you fear, it only confirms that you still fear it. The same is true of where you might glance. If there’s something disgusting right in front of us, many people involuntarily glance at it even though they don’t want to. The important thing here is that you reacted negatively to your eyes briefly checking out your mom and a young girl. You cannot be blamed for a thought that pops into your head you didn’t want or your eyes glancing at something you don’t want to glance at. The more you fear it, the more it’s likely to happen. It’s just the way OCD works.If you trust yourself and ignore those glances or intrusive thoughts, the fear will eventually subside and stop happening.",
      "catnaps wrote: If you have a fear of being attracted to something, and you have OCD, your mind will invariably bring up those thoughts. I can attest to this. At the height of my POCD a year ago and the many months following, I would get disturbing mental pictures in my head at the sight of anything that would trigger me. Even just minding my own business with no triggers I would occasionally get intrusive images. They did eventually stop, almost completely, a few months ago once my anxiety went down surrounding this theme, but now that I'm currently in an awful flare-up stage, they are back and unfortunately pretty frequent."

      "about a while ago i joined a lolicon discord server, my implications where to investigate it and report it. to join i had to dm the owner of the server 10 loli images, i did do so by going to an art site that for some reason allows it and then i downloaded the first 10 loli photos i saw and dmed it, i then got into the server and i looked around for a bit, then i reported it. now what im scared about is the loli dm photos, im not scared of my account getting deleted, im scared of a screenshot of it going out on the internet. i have a pretty ok following on x and i'm currently in a relationship. i'm scared of them finding out and then missunderstanding me, thinking that im a lolicon. i never intended to make it look like that and i am really bad at apologies. i am not and never will be attracted to children and i regret getting the idea of joining in the first place, i had seen people doing it online and thought it would be interesting. i am on the verge of deleting my account and creating an alt just to remove the evidence that it was me, all i want is to not be hated.",
      "Wanted to come back and say that i had looked at that stuff before, when i saw it i had gotten aroused. i am scared of ending up being attracted to that stuff. ive deleted everything that would give me access to it, i still have bluesky and such but i have blocked all words related to that stuff. at one point i had been curious and had found a video of (i wont make it too gross) a real child being put in a suspicious situation. i had downloaded it at that time on my phone and deleted it the same day, it happened a few times over those a few months. the videos were deleted the same day as well. i can at least explain that i am not attracted to it yet i have a giant ammount of anxiety of being attracted to children in the future of my life, thats why im putting down restrictions (all this happened around age 13-14) so i didn't really think about consequences. i am trying to cut all of it out of my life and just hope for the best. (i dont  feel an attraction to this btw, i only really felt it when i saw it, i knew it was bad and i didnt want to feel like that) thank you for listening, i love you all. if you want to, please feel free to give advice on how to calm myself when anxiety about this (and the first post) kick in.",
      "i did a reply about more stuff like this. but i forgot to clarify that i am not attracted to that stuff currently, i am scared of BEING attracted to it in the future. i am not currently attracted to anything related to children, and i haven't been ever since. i also don't fully believe i'll end up being attracted to it. i think figured out that i may have pocd (pedophile ocd) where (from what i know) is where someone is scared of being a pedo. i will say after reading some peoples stuff on here, i have less anxiety about it. this was a comment to just clarify that im not attracted to it because i dont believe i put it that well in the one which is waiting or approval",
      "Since this is taking a OCD-style anxious obsession tone, this thread's been moved to the obsessive-compulsive forum, as posts on this kind of thing are legion in OCD forum.

      "I'm new here, but have been dealing with OCD (without compulsions, depression and anxiety for over 35 years. I've taken tricyclics and SSRIs with OK success. About 6 weeks ago I had something trigger an episode, and it has never stopped.  After 17 years Lexapro just suddenly stopped working.  I got into a psych after a couple weeks, and he put me on Prozac.  As of yesterday we made the decision to up the dose to 80mg. I'm utterly miserable, dealing with side effects while waiting for something to happen.  The obsessions are still there, I'm depressed and wound up like a cheap spring.  I'm still eating despite poor appetite and am down around 15 pounds. I'm just basically ranting here.  I'm so tired of feeling like this, and afraid I have no other real options (basically Zoloft and Effexor), I've tried so many others.  Any advice?",
      "Hello and welcome! I've taken Lexapro for general anxiety. Not for my OCD. I was also given Trazodone as a sleep aid, and I mention that because if I recall, Trazodone is sometimes prescribed off-label for OCD. I think it's common in Europe (I'm American). I did experience some quelling of OCD while I was on Lexapro/Trazodone, but whether it was the combo, the Trazodone, or the Lexapro, I really can't say. If you haven't tried the Trazodone you might ask about it. Old school antidepressant, for me (and others) as a sleep aid it usually didn't cause intense drowsiness, but sort of quieted the mind enough for sleep to happen, and made the sleep sounder. I don't miss the Lexapro, but I so sometimes miss the Trazodone."

      "I've been suffering from POCD for about 10 months now (last October), I remember it beginning when on Twitter, one of my followers liked some rather questionable content I ended up reporting because it was disturbing and since then, I felt guilty for something. It shocked me, disturbed me and I had nightmares over it. Those feelings slowly began causing panic, anxiety (which I never had) and over the holidays, it began making me think I was some sort of monster and the intrusive thoughts came; ugly images, making me question who I was and depression soon followed. It began hindering my way of life, I began isolating a lot, my family bonds decreased, I could no longer watch shows or movies that had children in them afraid it'd trigger me and I became hyper aware of my body sensations. Something as seeing an image of a child on social media would trigger fear and wanting to get away. At some point, I figured I needed help so I sought treatment. I was introduced to porn at a young age and masturbation has been a regular thing in my life but the intrusive thoughts now seem to happen during that alone time. I've never had thoughts like this before - I'm a gay adult male, always had relationships within my age range and never had any problematic crushes or attractions. It's seem like a loss of identity. I have good days and bad days, where I'm able to tell the OCD apart and see how \"silly\" it can be and others where I'm so deep in the hole, I wonder am I turning into something I know deep down I'm not? So here came the Google searching for what's constitutes POCD from the actual thing, thinking I fell into one bracket but then doubting I could be one. There was a point I would gage my reaction to \"test\" to a simple photo on social media of a child smiling and I felt so gross, horrified because of even doing that. I've read people test themselves as \"proof\" and despite it being a sexual act, anything you're masturbating to can achieve climax. In the throes of these ugly feelings, I know I don't want it and despite the body feeling sensation, I felt so horrible afterwards feeling I've become a P. I'm seeing a therapist since the early part of the year, been working on ERP and some therapies. I wish my area had local OCD support groups or a community to help me feel not so alone outside of my therapist sessions, hence what brought me to join this site, I don't want to feel alone. I don't want to feel I'm reassurance seeking, just want to tell my story. I feel scared and empty thinking of my whole 32 years of life of being attractive to grown men, that because of something on Twitter someone was liking, I'm now in a nightmare loop. When I think of a relationship, I think someone my age. I don't have crushes on minors and I can't bring myself to look at one in public because I feel like a monster or afraid where my eyes look, I bet it's a mental compulsion. My therapist and doctor diagnosed me with POCD but at times, it's terrifying if I'm in denial or OCD is really that strong.",
      "OCD is a right bitch. Did you have any kind of anxiety issues before this?  You say you never had anxiety, but have you ever had compulsions of any kind, that this must be done, or that might happen?  Anything?  NOT disputing the diagnosis- just it's more common than not, that things like this don't arise just out of a vacuum.  Oh, also drug use?  If I got paid for every time someone on here said, 'I was smoking weed one day, and.....'  Also if not, consider that a warning- pot promoters might talk about how weed is great for anxiety, but oh hell no it isn't when you have anxiety issues like OCD.  Don't even think about self-medication that way.  The few times I've tried it recreationally  I wound up just a damn mess.  It's all fun until that paranoia hits.  Then you're in Hell.  It will bite you in the ass faster than you can blink. Sexual OCD themes are pretty pernicious and really tough.  Because I think sexuality is so fuzzy.  I mean, sure I could find a young person sexually attractive- but that doesn't make me a pedo, I don't have a special attraction to youth, much less children.  When we had a paraphilias forum, it was pretty clear that pedophiles, hebephiles, ephebophiles, were attracted to the age ranges they were for its own sake.  But because, again, we're sexual creatures and we're wired to glom onto youth and beauty, once you get this into your head as an obsessional form of anxiety, it's really rough on a person.  Seems to take a lot of work to get past it.  OCD is the Doubting Disease, and you can't help but constantly doubt yourself. I'm glad you already know about 'checking' or 'testing' or whatever you want to call it, because it's bad, bad bad bad try not to do it.  It means nothing, in an OCD context.  OCD will twist whatever result you got and even if you like went totally soft or something, trust me, read some threads here, and you'll see that OCD will find some way to turn everything on its head and work out a way to 'prove' that whatever the 'testing' results in, you're still a pedo.  Because that's how sexual and gender OCD themes work.  You're a clever person- I am convinced the chances of falling into OCD increase with intelligence, because we imagine stuff, and we imagine it really well- and your clever OCD brain will work overtime to create new opportunities for anxiety.  Been there and done that with my Harm OCD. OCD- and it seems especially sexual themes like 'POCD' are really good at hitting you when you're well, pleasuring yourself.  For some poor souls that have posted here, it's as if anything enjoyable, sexual or not, gets tied up with pedophile fears- OCD loves to suck the joy out of things.  So yeah it's totally normal and not at all surprising that those alone times you are going to be second-guessing the hell out of yourself. powerranger91 wrote: I remember it beginning when on Twitter, one of my followers liked some rather questionable content I ended up reporting because it was disturbing and since then That's common as dirt with this OCD theme.  An offhand comment, a dodgy photo or two, and for the right kind of person, the brain gloms onto it and won't let it go.  One day you're totally unconcerned, then the next day after that one event, you're wondering if you're some sort of monster. No reassurance from me.  I'm OCD, but I've never particularly suffered from POCD- that's one thing I've always been able to nip in the bud.  I won't ruminate or entertain the thought, because I don't want to fall into that trap.  I had Harm OCD for many years- decades- and I've learned that it doesn't matter what I think of, dream, fantasize, etc.- it's what I'll DO.  I am not a killer (my harm OCD), because I've never done it, and I'm not going to do it, and I make the decision to not worry about it, until I've done it.  And when I get even the barest tickle of POCD, I tell myself that well, I'm not one, I'm not going to start second guessing myself, I'm not going to worry about it.  I'll worry about it when I am one, not before.  When it comes to OCD, we have to take the attitude that we are NOT our thoughts.  OCD would have us think every thought equals real life action or desires, and that's simply not so.  If anything, being diagnosed with OCD, and worrying obsessively about being a pedophile, probably says a lot about what kind of person you really are- which is the opposite of what your OCD is screaming at you.",
      "Hi there, thank you for replying. To be quite honest, I don't remember having anxiety prior to this. The only times I could say I felt something like that was akin to giving a presentation before a group of people or running into an ex-boyfriend I didn't want to see. Other than that, I would say I was rather anxious-less (if that's a word) and mostly a worrier. I may have had some small compulsion in regards to organization but nothing debilitating that I can remember. No drug usage here, I've only tried weed twice in my early 20's and it was not for me, although I did get suggestions from people to try it once OCD and anxiety began happening and I read up on some negative experiences people have with it so I opted not to do that. Oh I agree, prior to OCD developing, I mostly dated people in my age range (either two years older or younger) because I wanted a relationship with someone who was in my state of mind so to speak, not too immature, or judgmental on where I was at life compared to them etc. I could notice cute characteristics in younger people such as \"Oh I like their hair\" or when people would show me their kids to give a compliment but it was never anything sexual or with a insidious meaning. When that happened on Twitter with stumbling across that horrible content, it shows what people repost I remember being horrified because how is this allowed there and who wants to see that. I reported it and the profile to an org that I also called that evening after a bad panic attack. I would say my anxiety began there, despite being told everything was fine and I did all I could, I felt I was dirty and guilty, that I should be ashamed. I carried that guilt, it began turning into anxiety, I couldn't look children in the eye, avoided them, couldn't watch shows or movies with them, kept getting intrusive thoughts until I felt I couldn't live like this anymore and sought help. I've been diagnosed with OCD, PTSD panic disorder and GAD and been taking meds and undergoing therapy. As for testing, I hate hate hate that I felt the need to do so. The way my mind pattern was during the time was I avoided looking at anyone who could be a minor, I would get a shot of panic or fear even scrolling on social media and it was not pleasant. But as it is common with people with OCD, we want that certainty, that definite answer so I tried and unfortunately, it sunk me into a deeper hole and more self doubt followed. I felt because I did that that confirmed and validated my fears so it made real arousal to grown men vulnerable to more intrusive thoughts and my OCD saying \"you're in denial\" or giving these weird urges to test again though I don't want to and I end up feeling worse. What's odd is knowing what I am attracted to and then suddenly feeling out of element, questioning who I am and not sure what is true or not. Though when I'm in a clear state of mind, I see clearly but man, being in the trenches, it's scary and with I think is false arousal, it makes you think you are what you fear. I do agree if you're testing by masturbation, you're going to be aroused well because you're engaging in something sexual. I also dread \"alone time\" now because my intrusive thoughts and false urges hit there and I hate it. I'm hopeful that therapy and medication will help me get out of the trenches and get back to living. I wanted to teach, have always wanted to have children of my own one day and I feel afraid it's begun robbing me of that because I know I don't have those desires despite what OCD says and I don't hurt people at all. Currently, leaving the house is tough at times. I feel dread seeing children, I can't look at them without my mind doing a Compulsion of \"are you attracted, why are you staring\" and then if I do stare I feel it's inappropriate, voices trigger me, I avoid shows and movies I used to love because children feature in them, it's been quite isolating and tough. I would think someone who had the actual thing would find desire and pleasure in that, meanwhile these last ten months have been incredibly lonely, terrifying and depressing. Sorry for the long reply, I wasn't knowledgeable in OCD before but reading, asking questions and reaching out has made me feel more comfortable sharing my story or wanting to find people who'd understand. At the end of the day, when I see a potential partner in life it's a grown adult male in my age range, not someone underage. I just wish it was easier to tell my mind that.",
      "powerranger91 wrote: and mostly a worrier Which is anxiety... I don't pretend to know how adults fall into this, except that your story is very common here- a single incident or comment seemingly setting it off like a string of dominoes.  I myself have been having OCD behaviors since... early childhood.  Although it didn't really kick into high gear until I was all of ten or so. powerranger91 wrote: although I did get suggestions from people to try it once OCD and anxiety began happening and I read up on some negative experiences people have with it so I opted not to do that. You have opted wisely. I think it's harder with sexual themes.  But I know I didn't get a handle on my intrusive harm thoughts until I learned to intentionally disregard them.  And I think POCD is only partly a sexual OCD, for that matter- there's a lot of fears of harming in there as well.  Look, I'll worry about it, when I've done it.  Not before.  In POCD terms, that's going to be when I come to myself and realise I'm in the act of molesting a child.  Not before.  Until then, it hasn't happened.  Until then, it doesn't matter what my mind says I am going to do, what I really want to do, none of it.  If it ain't happened, it don't exist . And it's not enough to do that- well I mean, when it comes to my harm intrusive thoughts, I have to not care if it happens.  So if I was getting bitten by the POCD bug bad (it has but nibbled, and I've bopped it on the head and sent it packing more than once) it's going to be not only has it not happened, I'm not going to care if it does . Now, deep down, that's a lie.  If I didn't care, then I wouldn't be obsessing over it.  But it's attitude.  You have to pull the snake's fangs.  You can't be afraid of what hasn't happened, and a big part of that is making the conscious decision to not care if it does.  Using my harm intrusive thoughts (to be blunt, intrusive thoughts I'll kill my partner), it's not enough to try to ignore the thoughts.  I have to not care.  Don't care.  Fine, I'm gonna do it, don't care.  Care when I do it and not before.  You have to call OCDs bluff.  If I allowed myself to care, then I open myself to worrying that I'll do it.  And having to deal with compulsions and all the rest of it.  Instead, I've learned to be like, whatever.  And ten minutes later (if that) I've totally forgotten it ever happened. Which only comes with a lot of practice.  In your terms, a lot of movies and going places and being like, whatever.  It's really hard to do.  It's not easy, but it's not magic, either.  For me, it's just out-stubborning the anxiety.  I'm not able to do that with all my anxiety issues, but I do manage it with things that involve intrusive thoughts of action- don't ask me why I have to travel to work using this route listening to this on the radio and do only that while I'm driving, I can whup some things but work anxiety?  damn that's real... But really I know OCD is OCD and if I'd apply myself to other anxiety issues it's all going to be the same sorts of fixes.  I'm guessing I practice a form of ERP with my intrusive harm, and the rare times pedo fears try to raise their head.  I did the same thing without knowing it, back when I used to have panic attacks in my 20s.  It'd happen specific places, and I had to make myself intentionally put myself in those places, consequences (heart attack) be damned.  And just like that, they stopped... You seem well read and self-aware, knowledge is power and I think you've made some good choices and starts on getting this under control- I won't say curing it.  I know of no one that's been cured of OCD.  It's managed .  You're always going to be tested.  It can lay fallow for a long time- months, years.  Then one day it'll give your brain a tickle, just to see if you're paying attention.  I mean, I've whupped my harm OCD for the most part, but at any random time a thought might pop into my head, and I have to be ready to not care and ignore it.  I know the moment I let myself give in to worry just a little, just a tiny bit- it'll force its way through the door.  That's never going to change, that's with me the rest of my Earthly life.  Something folks don't realise and they'll lose the anxiety, then years later be back here because it's come back on them like a ton of bricks.  So, I think a wise choice is to take the attitude that you're living with this thing, and it's not leaving, so you have to learn to manage the beast.  For me, I visualise OCD as an imp, or a demon.  It has taken squatter's rights in my head.  I can't get rid of it, but I can keep it starved for food- that food being anxiety.  OCD creates anxiety for sustenance; I have to deny it.  The more I can deny it my fear, the weaker it is and the less fear it's able to gin up.  And it's a game that never ends.  But with practice, it can be kept in its place.",
      "I think I may have shown some seeds of OCD forming over the years but never realized. Worrying about stuff like friendships, relationships and other themes until this unfortunate one happened. My therapist and I are going to dive into that. I'm happy to hear you're doing well with your Harm OCD and managed to keep POCD at bay. I will apply the method you use about I'll worry when it happens and it's a good way to not fall into the OCD thought spirals and traps it sets, thank you for that. Pull the fangs from the snake I'll remember that. I had a bad weekend which I felt completely lost and feared the worst then the days got better. My therapist and I are working on ERP and CBT challenging the thoughts which some have helped. Two especially \"Is this thought hurting or helping me\" and \"Is this my true self or feared self?\" That's been the thing keeping me stuck is avoidance and the constant testing compulsion. Going out and about avoiding eye contact, staring, worrying if I'm attracted or not since it's so confusing, never had this dilemma before and then of course during \"alone time\" having intrusive thoughts come in and wondering if it's something suppressed or OCD being so manipulative. I think that's one thing that can cause POCD sufferers is wondering if they like the thoughts or OCD is pulling the strings, the false urges, arousal and attraction. I know that's what dug its heels deeper in me was when I did a compulsion of testing arousal and attraction through masturbation and climaxed, however when I think of a perfect partner, it's an adult male but it feels like a form of self reassurance. I think I would have shown some sort of past if I was a P in denial and it couldn't just develop. Though, I'm unsure how real urges or false attractions can get, when I'm in the OCD spiral it feels real and then when I'm out of it, I feel nothing. Though I can say when it happens, I feel disgust, fear, anxiety. Thank you again for responding. Considering how isolating and lonely this disorder can be to a person, you have no idea how your response has helped to know I'm not alone in this. I appreciate it.",
      "This forum is plenty proof you're not alone!  People will come and go, they'll get better, then have a setback and return, or get better and stay better (I hope, presume).  But you see there's no lack of POCD stories here.",
      "That's the best thing about finding this forum is knowing you're among people who know what you're going through. I've had some days of clarity this past week and felt like my old self again and then it's like OCD spikes then here comes the thoughts -- I'm determined to beat this. Thank you for the clarification and insight. I think the only thing that bothers me are the testing (staring compulsion) but I'm sure I'll conquer it one day. I feel distress, fear and ugly feelings when OCD hits so it's getting easier to know when it's OCD striking."

      "Hey guys! i'm new here so please be supportive. i've always been the really jealous type and recently got my first gf. (i'm 16). even tho she's my first gf we decided to sleep together and it was fun. i've also dealt with anxiety and intrusive thoughts in the past. but one day i read upon cuckoldry. i obviously wasn't into the fetish but it was just interesting how someone could ever get turned on by that. i thought it was kinda funny. but then i got scared that what if secretly deep down i'm into it or what if one day i look at the fetish with a new perspective and get into it. or what if i become OK with the idea my gf / future wife sleeping with other guys. thai is freaking me out so much and it has affected my daily life. i think about it 24/7 and constantly have to find ways to reassure i'm not a cuck. i don't ever want to be a cuck. i keep getting images of my gf in bed with someone else and it makes me sick to my stomach and full of anxiety but deep deep deep down i get kinda aroused. idk if this is just cause i'm imagining sex and no matter who and what it's always gonna be somewhat arousing. oh and also i am not addicted to porn in any way. i rarely watch it as when i masturbate i just use my imagination. last time i watched it was a month ago. honestly i never want to become a cuck. do you guys think i am or will????????? please any help will be great. also i'm looking for solutions that don't have to do with a therapy or counseling.",
      "Hello and welcome. You'll notice we've placed this in OCD-that's not a pronouncement, but this seems to be similar to intrusive fears of being gay, transgender, etc. Like those things-you're worrying about something that hasn't happened, yet. We can't talk about fetishes on PF, but this does seem to be more a fear of it, than the thing, itself. My advice would be that with an anxiety like this, you have to make your mind up, that you're not a cuck, and stick to that story, in the face of these thoughts. Intrusive fears can be quite insistent and you'll come up with reason, after reason, to stay afraid. Have you been cuckolded? No. Have you plans to (and not in some vague future)? No? Then let the evidence speak for itself, and insist to yourself, that you're not.... Very insightful, by the way, to guess that perhaps the titillation you do feel, is because it's sex. I think you're close to the truth with that. Sex titillates, even when it's something you don't want to do, yourself...",

      "I'm 28 years old And I struggled many ocd themes including hocd, pocd and etc. Yesterday I was watching a youtube video and there was a girl about 8 or 9 years old. I saw her leg and butt, and then suddenly I looked it. I didn't feel any sexsual things, but after I looked I felt very guilty. Thoughts popped up to my mind like \"Did you want it?\", \"Did you attract her legs?\" I know I'm not pedophile. May be this is normal thing whick is a everyone experienced. But now I am worrying that I attracted that girl? What do you think? Is this normal?",
      "Hello and welcome. I think this is perfectly normal.  People get all sorts of stray thoughts in their head, they suddenly notice things, etc.  And most people let it go and don't think another thing about that thought.  An ordinary person, a Normie as I like to call them, would have maybe thought 'well that was an odd thing for me to think', and then let it go.  If they even were that self-aware.  I wager that most times they might not have even gone that far with the thoughts you had when you looked. It's when you have OCD that you pick apart every random thought that has even a little to do with whatever current fear (or past fears) that you've been obsessing over.  I have had Harm OCD for many years- intrusive thoughts and anxieties about hurting others.  I had to train myself to disregard random thoughts like that.  I do the same with POCD- that is to say, I've never suffered from POCD in any meaningful fashion, because early on, when my OCD tried to take me down that particular rabbit-hole to self-Hell, I squashed such ruminations quickly- I wouldn't let myself go down that line of thinking, and refused to let myself start to wonder if my touching a child was sexual, or if an image of a child was something that sexually excited me. I think part of the problem is that we're sexual beings.  And sexual thoughts, desires, proclivities, etc., are not always well defined- they're not Black and White, they're not Ones and Zeros.  They're fuzzy, they're sometimes very ill-defined, they're sometimes very difficult for a person to put a label on.  And OCD screams at us that everything be Yes or No, and that we can put a label on everything .  Even when we can't. Any of us might have done what you did.  In isolation, it means nothing.  Nothing.  Noticing a minor's body in a photo, video, whatever, doesn't mean a thing unless it's part of a larger pattern. If you were a pedo, you'd know it.  We had a Paraphilias forum- it's now locked, but we used to be a safe haven for pedo/hebe/ephebophiles to discuss their quandary.  They bloody well knew what they were attracted to, and what they weren't attracted to.  If you have to ask yourself 'am I a pedo', and you have a history of OCD, then you can probably blame it on the OCD.  I've had plenty of sexual angst over my lifetime that in other people in this forum would probably be HOCD.  You mention you've had HOCD.  Well, in my case, I'm Bisexual.  And I know bloody well what turns me on and what doesn't, no matter how much I ruminate over it and feel angsty over it and hate it and all the rest.  I've obsessed plenty over my sexuality, but I've never had HOCD because well, when you want the same sex, you want the same sex and you can fool yourself only to a certain extent that it ain't so.  Well, it's the same with genuine pedophiles.  The heart wants what the heart wants, and the heart darn well knows it. But what you posted, I'm willing to put money that most people experience things like that, and don't think much of it, because they aren't pedophiles.  The trouble comes with us, because with OCD, we always pick everything we think and say and do apart with a fine-toothed comb, we overanalyse, we equate a thought, with reality.  Just because I think of doing something, doesn't mean I really want to do it, or would ever do it, or am compelled to do it.  But with OCD, it can be really hard to remember that.  With OCD, we always leap to conclusions and take things to the worst logical imagined outcome.  And we have wicked good imaginations when it comes to thinking up things we fear being, doing, or having happen to us.  And that's something we have to learn to not do.",
      "Thank you! But it was not like ocd things, I am feeling like that. So theese thougts are worrying for me. I shouldn't looked her. When thougts popped up to me, I must be feel uncomfortable. Because, she is just a kid. I didn't act like that..."

      "Not too many days ago I visited psychiatrist and I shared some information about GAD, possible OCD/POCD, an she diagnosed me with GAD and OCD. There are some some things I forgot to say (honestly), and I'm in total fear. I don't seek reassurance, just need explanation. Well, after the feel of relief I started thinking: \"What if isn't really OCD and I'm a p word?\" The reasons of doubting are some thoughts and one episode of my life. Both of them provoke anxiety and different feelings. I'd like to begin with the thoughts. When I see a child on the street or on the Internet (especially news about SA), my mind starts sexualising it and the discomfort or slight anxiety with strange feelings in the groinal area start to appear. There are also some thoughts which support that $#%^ and I'm in doubt that I'll never harm a child. I understand that I don't want to do cruel things to anybody in the world, but, unfortunately, I'm still doubting. There was a thought tat caused distress to watch illegal material. OFC I didn't. About the episode: the doubting about my fear to become a p-word began in the midlle of January, 2023. After the uncountless amount of researches, mental tests if I'm straight or P, I decided to masturbate on intrusive thought. Maybe due to low libido, maybe due to another reason, there was nothing. But I decided to go further and added 2 kinks to intrusive thought during testing. ###$, I reached orgasm. It was fast and full of anxiety. After the whole process I wanted to cry and to commit suicide. And I started avoiding any interaction with a child, I decided not to pursue a perspective to find a gf and to become a father. Moreover, I had plans to become a teacher at the language centre. After that episode I gave up with that idea. Well, I need some explainments about my current mental condition. Does that behaviour somehow relate to OCD with sexual obsessions or I am pervert? The answers from therapists specialising in OCD/GAD/sexologists will be appreciated. Thanks for reading.",
      "No answers from therapists here- we're peer support.  If anyone practices therapy here, I practice using the banhammer. And, you say you're not asking for reassurance, but yeah really I think you are.  It feels as if you're looking for ways to keep worrying you're a P and not accepting a OCD diagnosis.  You're behaving in this post like many many other people do here.  Very OCD-like, in other words.  There's nothing in this post I haven't basically seen before as a moderator here.  Multiple times.  And I'm reassuring you."

      "This happened again. I just want to die, the guilt and pain is killing me. I really want to die and if this doesn't get better when my birthday comes around I'm really going to leave, I don't deserve to be here, I deserve to suffer, I'm sure this is not ocd, although deep down I want to believe that it is. I am not this, I never wanted this and I will never want it. My head hurts from crying so much, I feel that I am playing the victim, I really don't know. I just want this to end, I don't want this. I was m#sturbating and I didn't want to do it, in fact I always avoid it because those thoughts come and I go into the horrible cycle again. I tried to just concentrate on the sensations, when I felt the climax near, an image of this person comes, and I felt the same feeling of wanting to climax, this happened many times, and at that very moment I thought of another person to avoid this thought of a family member, and I wanted to replicate the same feeling of wanting to climax, I concentrated on this other person but at the same time there was the image of that relative and every time I saw him it made me feel like I wanted to climax and I saw the other person and I think it also made me feel that, I do not remember and then I could not replicate it so I decided to continue with the climax (that this image of family member produced) and I concentrated on the sensation. Do you know what it means? I feel like I masturbated and used that thought of this family member. I don't even know why I tell it, but i deserve to being looked at with disgust and hatred. I was fine, I was, but every time I wanted to do this m#sturbation thing, things like that happen, even when I read, it's everywhere, it's overwhelming and that's why I avoid almost everything. I'm sorry, sorry, sorry",
      "With OCD it’s so easy to trick yourself into believing horrific things about yourself, especially sexually. When it comes to that extreme anxiety coupled with sexual thoughts and feelings, you could truly convince yourself you’re attracted to anything through checking while masturbating, or thinking of something you don’t want to around when you orgasm. In the end, I think you know there is nothing to this aside from your OCD. You fear you’re a certain type of person, but you are not actually that person or else it wouldn’t be tormenting you so much. OCD/Anxiety is so cruel in that regard, that it can give you extreme doubt about yourself. But you CANNOT ever check to see if you’re attracted to something or give any credence to unwanted thoughts that pop into your head. I know it feels messed up to just ignore those thoughts, but I promise that by doing so the anxiety around them will go away and then the thoughts themselves will go away. I’m so sorry you’re going through this, but this is just your OCD, it’s not you.",
      "Hello catnaps, thank you again for your answer. The things is that I think I don't have anxiety, back then I used to have it when these situations happened, my heartbeats were fast, but now that doesn't happen, I think, i dont knowww. Sometimes my heart beats very fast in other situations related to these thoughts... what if I didn't have anxiety in these situations anymore? I know I need to stop doubting but it is so difficult... thank you -- Sun Jul 21, 2024 3:54 pm -- The only thing that Im sure I feel, that happened before, is that I know that those thoughts are going to come and I'm kind of anticipating and of course I don't want them, sometimes it's like everything freezes and the thoughts come and the feelings or I know that these thoughts are going to come and I try not to see them or I think of someone else or I concentrate on some object, but they still come...."

      "Hiya I have a post on here already but wanted to start afresh one as it's been 7 years since my last entry I have suffered with every type of ocd for many years, decades. I'm in my 50's now and it's still no easier. I had a major health issue a few weeks ago and came back all clear for cancer although I have to have further investigations. It was two weeks of hell think the worst possible scenario that's what ocd does. Anyway this has cause a trigger relating to an incident that happened over 40 years ago. Very scared by writing this. When I was 13 years I stayed at my gym teachers house. Her little girl was I believe about 4. We were sat in the sofa reading a book and mum said its bedtime so we went upstairs and she went into the bathroom. I followed and then gave her some space on the toilet so I walked to the door entry, Mum was still downstairs, I asked if she finished, got some toilet roll and wiped her, but as soon as I did. I though should I have done that. Could she had done it herself?. I'd never taken a child to the toilet before so was unsure. Mum came in not long after and I was going to say that I'd assisted her but thought I'd done something wrong so I didn't say anything. Since this event I have never taken a child to the toilet. I've never been able to conceive children which I love. I have neices and nephews who I love immensely. I have soneone that i can confind in but they say \"oh no not this again\" so I keep it to myself. Every day this in my mind, somewhere. This has spiked probably 5 times in my lifetime. I normally end up on medication anxiety medication which brings me back to some normality for a few years. Thanks for listening I can most of the time put it to the back of my mind but any very stressful life situation triggers it and starts all over again.",

      "Hi im new to this forum. I have lived with ocd since my mid twenties Im now 48, didnt get diagnosed for years. I am on medication 250mg of Clomipramine (Placil) which has really helped me. But I having an episode after about 5 years with nothing major, slight obsessions but have been able to concur the thoughts. I dont know what to do scared im goin to get in the same position i did many years ago in my 30s. I have every ctype of ocd throughout the years. Its very distressing and I wish it would just didappear",
      "Dear tia123: Healing/ managing anxiety takes an enormous amount of patience. Medication doesn't heal us; sometimes, for various lengths of time, we feel better when taking it, that is all. Wishing OCD would just disappear, oh I wish that too- I wish all my anxiety would just disappear, all those neuropathways that have caused me distress in my five decades of living and suffering from anxiety and its consequences/ symptomology: OCD, Tourette Syndrome and later life diagnosed. There are ways to heal, ways you already took on which worked. Have to persist, repeat, one small step at a time, with great gentleness and kindness to yourself and an enormous, never ending patience with the process. atina",
      "Thank u for your reply. Im not having a good day didnt sleep very well. Just obsessing about something that has happened at work. I can sometimes assure myself that its just ocd and im fine for a few moments. Then bang its back again. I have wasted over 35 years with this condition. I dont knowwhat to do. I live on my own. The only person i can talk to about my ocd is my ex who lives overseas. Im so scared",
      "Dear tia123: When I am most anxious, a very hot bath does wonders for me. Soft music while in the bath... Daily exercise, a fast walk, half an hour every day after work can greatly help. Yoga stretches after each walk, a routine of this kind can make a difference. Exercise is like taking an elevator down from the obsessing, overthinking brain, to the body.b Before I started to exercise I saw myself like a giant floating head, full of thoughts. When I started yoga, I got to know my body, oh, here is this muscle I didn't know I had... and that muscle. And as you hold a pose or stretch, you don't think, you just feel this or that part of the body. Basically feeling the body, sensing the heat of bath water, listening to music, engaging the five senses is what the practice of Mindfulness is about. These are very helpful for anxiety. Exercising and engaging the senses is taking a much needed BREAK from the overthinking brain. atina",
      "Thank u for replying it means a lot. Dont feel so much alone. I know I have to get off my butt and get a grip. Ive hit the destroy button once again. This is a terrible condition to have and im tired of fighting it. May ring a helpline number to see what they say.",
      "Dear tia123: You are welcome. You wrote: \" I know I have to get off my butt and get a grip \"- This is what I learned, and it is a very important learning, so I'd like to share it with you: talk nicely to yourself. Saying to yourself: \"Get off your butt and get a grip!\" is an unkind thing to say. Whatever you will not say to a young child, don't say to yourself. Be gentle and kind to yourself. Be endlessly patient with yourself. Talk to yourself as if you are a scared, discouraged young child. Don't beat her up, pressure her, bully her. This change of attitude toward yourself will help a whole lot, over time, with your anxiety/ OCD. Post again, anytime. atina",
      "I didnt have a very good weekend. I made myself go to work rather than lying here overthinking. It feels as though that thick fog has been lifted.Im enjoying the release from all the obsessing. No doubt it will be c triggered off again at some point. Im seeling my doctor on wez to get some CBT treatment. I have been fighting this for far to long, wasted so many years. Just hope i dont relapse",
      "Hi I haven't been on forum for a few years but learnt to sort of live as best I can with ocd, with medication, still very hard though. I had a trigger last year and ended up on a psychotic medication which helped me. I tried CBT but that didnt help. Im my own worst enermy. Stress and anxious about everything. However in the last few weeks I have had a major health scare which I totally blew out of proportion.I have to have further investigations. I got some relief and felt normalish for one night and the next day bang a :trigger\" relating to an incident that happened over 40 years ago. This has been discussed on this forum before and I was reassured that I had done nothing wrong and was just helping. Feel like im disassociated from the environment around me, right now. I live on my own and find it hard to tell anyone as they don't understand the severity of my condition. Ive told one other person but they have their own issues. I keep it quiet. Hope I can get some help and guidance. Many thanks",

      "Several minutes ago I read an article about a politician. He stated that he didn't think he was gay in high school and had a crush on a girl. When he attended college he felt his \"latent homosexuality\" emerging and came out in his mid-30s. I've had HOCD since May 2006, and this year marks 18 years since I was afflicted with this obsession. I've made major progress, but a part of me still wonders if I'm denying the inevitable and just living a lie. I'm 37 and never had a long term girlfriend and my mom asked if I was gay years ago although that's stopped.

      "So let me start with thiewe things. I know no one can say what I am, I am just looking for input from fellow HOCD sufferers. I’ve never had these thoughts before the following moment. I have however seen how guys could be good looking solely from. Woman’s perspective and yes I’ve thought Chris hemsworth was good looking at one point but nothing more than that. I have no problem with gays and have gay friends in the past and an Uncle who was gay who my nan hated and I fought to defend him at the age of 15 and his right to be who he is and we should be happy and accept who he is. I stand by that to this day and am extremely happy for him even if his mother wants to be a total b***h I’ve always felt awkward in locker rooms hate being around naked guys and always prefer to go home and take a shower I'm the privacy of my own home. I just don’t like being naked around people who aren’t my partner period. I also have a very frail skinny body and got ridiculed for it constantly even by my kendo teacher in the locker rooms and in the pub. Which did make me want to look at guys to see how inferior my body was which reinforced more negative self image. I’ve always wanted a girl and I finally met someone and we are engaged and I truly love her with all my heart and would give my life for her in an instant. She is however my first love at the age of 31 now 32, we are in a very long distance relationship but have met up multiple times. When we first kissed I didn’t like it it freaked me out that it didn’t and I left. Following times I got this uncontrollable urge to throw her to the ground grab her breasts and pussy and just embrace her fully. I didn’t understand why I just did. I Still didn’t feel like I enjoyed missing. I did love eating her out though. However when I didn’t like kissing she asked if I was gay, she kept on asking multiple times. It forced me to test myself. So I briefly looked at gay porn it freaked m out and scared me. Not because I liked it but because once I registered what I was sewing it personally disgusted me. Now I’m not saying gay sex with men is disgusting, it’s just not for me in the same way a gay guy probably wouldn’t like eating a woman out or pounding her pussy. Different strokes for different folks. Now suddenly for the first times after her asking if I was. I saw a guy got a rush found him attractive and wondered if he was single. I then started finding guys I knew for years suddenly attractive when I know I don’t actually find them sexually attractive. A guy I assumed was gay then smiled at me on the bus. I then smiled back wondered what his deal was and who the other guy with him was and if he was interested in me. Both of these thoughts made me sick panic and anxious because that is not the me I known yet they felt so real. It happened again one more time. Before this she kept on insisting I don’t cheat on her and I actually started wondering if other women were single and imagined kissing them which also shook me to my core because that’s not the guy I am. It’s swapped from women to guys. When I used to watch porn and see say a gang bang or bukkake video it would focus on the guys jerking off and I hated it I don’t want to see guys jerking off and I still don’t. I watched this video with this girl and two guys and the guts started doing gay stuff I did not like it, it was not for me I instantly turned it off and lost all arousal. I recently looked at gay porn as a compulsion and got 0 arousal. Intact my dick shrinked. I loomed at it and was like I should be aroused right I should be mastibating right I like guys now but nothing. As soon as I swapped to images of sexy women I was mastibating imagining sexual stuff and wanting to so stuff to them. So everything seems pretty clear cut right. The fact I used to think this with other women when she suggested I may cheat on her because of the distance so I panicked and had thoughts about that. Then she asked if I’m gay and now I’m packing about that. Gay porn does not arouse me being with guys does not arouse me 99% of the time occasional o feel something but I think it’s because I’m focusing on how it feels and not the person. I can’t stop finding guys attractive, then the same guy unattractive then 3 hours later attractive again. That experience I had when I wondered if that guy was single and feeling jealousy over the guy who looked at me however has me majorly doubting what seems to be obvious. Has anyone with HOCD ever experienced jealousy like this or wondering if a guy is single.  I feel like this suggests Bi but the sexual thoughts actually freak me out and have got to the point of making me physically vomiting. I don’t want to suck a dick and I don’t want to ###$ an asshole not even a woman’s. But those two experiences just have me stuck in a loop. Is it possible where I truly thought I was gay/bi that I just instinctively acted like that because my brain convinced myself of it. Which would explain why I felt so sick afterwards, because that is not and has never been me up until the constant questioning of if I was gay. I know I can’t be gay because I still dig my lady and women very much so and they are the only sex that gets me aroused and wanting to have sex. I've had amazing conversations with attractive guys been worried I'm sexually attractive in person yet there was 0 attraction. I was convinced I would be attractive because we got on on a very deep level yet nothing. I'm at a point where going to the office makes me sick, being around guys makes me sick and I just can't live anymore. I am physically vomiting."

      "Content Warning: This topic deals with sexuality and abuse. Hi, I'm a 24 year old male, hoping to vent about my current blunder. A few years back, I got myself into writing (mainly fanfictions) when I was going through a particularly dark chapter of my life; and I found the act of writing to be therapeutic. I often used various aspects of my life and my past self for inspiration. Stories very rarely turned out great, but they had their admirers and I enjoyed the fact that my readers seemed to enjoy what I wrote. I took two large breaks and lately been trying to get back into my writings once more; but something has been bothering me lately. I usually write romantic fiction - some blatantly explicit and focused on sexual content, while others tend to be proper narratives with underlying themes of love and sexuality. I was fine with that; I'm not religious and it didn't conflict with my worldview - until lately, that is. Recently this thought crept up into my head - \"If someone gets off from reading my stories, aren't I the one getting them off?\" It feels gross; because my OCD-riddled brain interprets it as equivalent to engaging in sexual activities with my readers; which, when written down like this, sounds very absurd because what remains of my rational mind knows that it is not actually the case. So, you get the idea - I feel conflicted. On one hand, I want to get back into my writings once more because I genuinely enjoyed it. On the other hand, it feels wrong because the irrational part of my mind sees it as 'having sex with strangers' despite how absurd that conclusion is. What might be noteworthy here is that I was a victim of SA while underage; which might explain why I have strong and often conflicting feelings when it comes to intimacy and sexuality. Anyway, I just wanted to vent a bit. I'm sure my brain will resolve it over time, just like all my previous problems. Meanwhile, any input would be much appreciated. Thank you for reading!",
      "A few thoughts on this. To me it seems like the equivalent of thinking the person who directed the porn you’re watching is the one getting you off. For your writing it may be more directly involved than a director, but still it’s primarily the person’s imagination of the characters that is what someone would be thinking of. As well, you are presuming that anyone is getting off to your works at all. And, even if they were, what is so wrong with that? There is a cultural shame from our puritan past around sex that isn’t warranted in my opinion. We are all sexual beings and should engage in it in healthy ways. Perhaps your own past trauma is causing the block here, but if writing is a positive outlet for you, then I think you should embrace it.",
      "Thank you; I came back to check up on my posts after a long time. I can see your logic and how I had made several absurd logical leaps. I have a better sense of clarity now. Thank you once more."

      "I heard that if you can masturbate in your fantasy without porn to stuff that's what you're attracted to. So I had a rough day today with my thoughts and when I got home I decided to force an erection to masturbate to gay fantasy and it started to feel good within a few second and would go away and come back depending on how much I self inserted with more self insertion feeling better. I decided to swap over to gay porn and when I self inserted as the bottom and when I started to feel like orgasm was coming I started to feel a lot of disgust, guilt and shame which seemed to make it stronger and I had to stop myself from actually finishing and went to actually finish to straight porn. Even though I have been able to get off quickly imagining a girl I thought I had a crush on when using my imagination it all feels fake and it feels like the feeling I had for her were just me trying to hold on to being straight so I forced it.",
      "I can remember for a good long while that I always worried I'm secretly gay probably since I was a very young teen. But I also have had nothing but crushes on girls assuming that I didn't fake them and I always wanted a wife and all that but that could have been heteronormativity. Also if I am just gay why would I get aroused enough at my first straight club visit to go back and then get really aroused going to the vip room thinking about the possibility of oral and even almost busting in my pants during the lap dances and I was obsessed with boobs and looking at models and such. But between the last post and all the other info plus the fact that I get aroused by penises in porn and I think I have for a long time now, getting off to fpov and putting myself as woman in porn and now the fantasies I really worry that I've just been gay this whole time and repressing it and denying it. I really wish I never got high that night I might have never gone through this and gay porn never used to do anything for me when I would come across it. I know reassurance and testing is bad, but is it possible for all this to happen because I'm subconsciously focusing on my groin when \"testing\" that causes my to be able to orgasm and it feels real?",
      "So when I woke up today I think I got aroused when fantasizing about a girl and one again decided to test and it felt like I had to concentrate harder and put more effort into imagining gay sex than when I was imagining a girl which I still kind of had to concentrate, but it just seemed to be easier. However, I wasn't able to achieve orgasm without using porn",
      "Please don't test.  Fantasize only about something you want to fantasize about.",
      "But why is it so much easier? And the memories",
      "Easier to what?",
      "Feel like having an orgasm or getting an erection."

      "I'm an assistant coach at a jiu-jitsu academy and opened the academy for an open training session this past weekend. A lady came in at the end of class to do a few minutes of cardio kickboxing and asked another student about the schedule. I was occupied with something else when the student quipped that she should talk to me because I'm the instructor. I informed her of the schedule and told her to come in next week to train. I'll add that she was attractive. She left and my teammate said, \"You just missed an opportunity.\" I said, \"I don't crap where I eat.\" He left and talked to another student outside and when I looked outside he glanced and smirked at me. The lady that came in had entered her vehicle and stayed for a minute before driving off. I'm concerned that he will say that I'm gay because I didn't ask the lady for her number. I've had spikes throughout the day that folks will assume I'm gay and treat me different, all because I didn't hit on this woman. It sounds far fetched but it's run through my mind. My reasoning is I don't want to creep the lady out asking for her number and all when I'm a coach. It's bad for the academy to hit on students or prospective students. I've always reasoned there are plenty of fish in the ocean.",
      "Well you have no proof that's what they were talking about being gay, and that's not the kind of thing you can control, anyway.   You had perfectly legit reasons for not hitting on her.",

      "Hi, Just hoping someone out there can help I have harm ocd. Over the last few months it has gotten worse. From a simple altercation and thinking I have blacked out and murdered to now if someone just looks at me ,I'm scared that I black out and kill. Even the cops are sick of me rining to check I haven't killed. Now I'm too scared to leave the house and when I do, I have my dash cam on and when I leave my car, I record ( voice record). My psychiatrist weaned me off zoloft and now I'm on prozac and I don't see a difference. I have been referred to the hospital for TMS. I know reassurance doesn't work amd it's obvious because the police have told me many times that \" it's all in my head.\" YET I believe that I may be blacking out and killing. So now I went from leaving my house and not recording to basically being a prisoner in my home and if I leave the house, and that's only for grocery shopping, I record my every move. Any advice? I don't want to harm anyone. I don't remember doing it. I have lost friends because of this. How do I leave my house? How do I be normal again? The thought of leaving my phone at home as exposure response therapy scares the crap outta me. I hope someone here can help. Thank you",
      "Well I'm sorry to hear it's gotten worse.  Pretty sure we've covered everything I could say, in previous threads.  I really can't add to it- it just takes being more stubborn than those intrusive thoughts, and having a little faith in yourself that you haven't done anything, and won't do anything.  Like I've said before, it takes practice.  I could go to bed tonite (which is when my thoughts usually hit) and I could nudge myself real easy into the same thing you're going through with the whole blacking out business and I won't be able to control myself and it'd be so EASY and what is stopping me? Oh, I could dig myself into that hole real easy.  But I've practiced disregarding the thoughts and deciding not to worry about them- that whole 'deferred anxiety' I've talked about.  And so I ignore it and it goes out of my mind and I fall asleep and wake up in the morning and imagine that, nobody's been killed.  In writing all this, by the way, I've triggered it and now I feel all the same kinds of anxieties you're feeling.  And I'll have to defer that anxiety, suck it up and ignore the stupid thoughts.  It's no big deal; it's only a big deal if I let it be a big deal.  So I won't.  Because I've practiced not letting it be a big deal, because I've made it a point not to act on any compulsions to quell the anxiety- I spit in the face of those thoughts.  They can't make me do anything.  Your harm thoughts can't make you do anything, either.",
      "Hey Snaga, Thanks for your quick reply and I'm sorry if I triggered the harm thoughts in you. I don't know how much more proof I need? The cops say they aren't after me. Why can't I just be happy knowing I haven't done anything wrong? Ugh",
      "Notmythoughts wrote: Hey Snaga, Thanks for your quick reply and I'm sorry if I triggered the harm thoughts in you. I don't know how much more proof I need? The cops say they aren't after me. Why can't I just be happy knowing I haven't done anything wrong? Ugh Don't be sorry, I intentionally let myself get triggered to prove a point.  That this can be handled, and easily, with enough practice.  Wasn't long before I'd forgotten all about it.  Which took practice.  Practice practice practice, and stubbornness. A story.  I used to get panic attacks.  This is when the Internet was just a gleam in Arpanet's eye.  There was no Doctor Google and I was still some time away from reading about panic attacks in a magazine.  Thought I was dying.  Also noticed I got them certain places, and started paying attention to when they happened, and where, and how my body and brain responded.  Figured out this was a mind game.  Once I'd done that, I started to outstubborn the things.  Where I'd just wanted to get out of wherever it was I was having the panic attack, I started standing my ground.  And... it took a few years, but especially after READING what they were and understanding 'yes, this IS a mind game' I finally was able to stop having them.  Practice practice practice, and a willingness to endure the anxiety spike, and a willingness to face down the bad thing that's 'going to happen' (and never does): heart attack (panic attack) being a murderer (harm OCD).  This is doable.  Doesn't feel as if it is, I know, but it is doable.  If I can do it, anyone can.",
      "OK so if I understood you, I need to do some exposure therapy. God it's gonna be hard. I will start off slow. So instead of immersing myself at the park that's full of kids and women ( somehow my harm ocd targets them), I will go to the shops for a short period of time and not record. So a quick trip to buy bread and milk, not record, probably feel like I've murdered someone and come home and feel that anxiety and try not to call the cops. How did I get this way?? I've spent 43 years without recording and now I've started at the age of 44. Why?? Snaga have you tried tms for ocd?",
      "yeah I guess that is what you call exposure therapy. And I've heard of TMS, but no I've not done anything for OCD.  I take Lexapro and Trazodone, but for generalised anxiety and insomnia.  That they happen to seem to help with other aspects of my OCD is incidental, my harm OCD thoughts I got under control long before I started taking meds.",
      "I've always had the harm ocd centred around unintentional harm; I've been checking the oven and stove from my teen years. The last year it's been the , \" blacking out and killing women and children\". Funny how it's not me killing a big muscly man. I was on the highest does of zoloft and seroquel at night for sleep. Now I have been Switched to prozac. I still have the same ocd. I think I'm medication resistant. Fml. Anyway, let's see if tms works or if I going to spend thousands on a gimmick which I could've spent on a holiday . But hey, gotta give it a try. If only I just saw my thoughts as just thoughts and not view myself as some psychopath that forgets her crimes ."

      "I've struggled with watching pornography for several years. It's been going on since I was a young teenager and I've exposed myself to a lot of things that I look back on with regret and shame. There have been instance where I looked at pornographic content featuring fictional characters that were around my age at the time and I didn't see a problem with that when I was younger. Now I feel really horrible about it. Absolutely disgusted. Nowadays when I relapse and look for porn, I only want to find pornography featuring fictional women that look like adults or whoever my go to characters are. Even then, sometimes I see disturbing things as I scroll through playlists or search results that have nothing to do with what I'm looking for. I hate it. I absolutely hate when I see a character being put in a scenario like that when I don't want to see it by any means but it shows up anyway. I feel like I'm a true p sometimes because of this. There's always been several occasions where I've doubted the person's age in a video whether real or fake. That drives me crazy. Especially when there's character's whose age aren't officially stated but can be hinted to be a young adult. I know I'm not attracted to children nor would I ever want to be but the thoughts about it don't go away. I also don't like how I've escalated to different videos when I was badly addicted. It always felt like I needed to go the extra mile to get the same dopamine as I did before. I don't feel like I need to escalate now but I do a lot of surfing with content to find the best one that truly fits. It was so much worse when I was a teenager. It was like I didn't seem to have limits when it came to what I watched at times. I'm glad I don't do that anymore but I'm still really upset that I've fallen this far into my addiction and to this day it's still hard not to watch pornography. I don't know what to think of myself. I just feel bad about myself because of this along with a lot of things in the past. I'm just afraid that this isn't all chalked up to POCD. I constantly think about one time where I surfed through watching videos of characters I was comfortable with but the channel that I thought only had adults there had one character that I was uncertain about their age. By the time this video showed up it was already at the point of no return. After that I just kept looking up the age for this character and many sources said 18 while I think I was 19 or 20 but I still had doubts. I really don't want to do this anymore but I just feel so weak in saying no. I just feel powerless against the urges at times."

      "I was better from thoughts, dreams about my theme. Actually this has happened a few times, I want to hear other people's opinion to tell me it is ocd and then I feel better. I always feel like what's stressing me is real and I get depressed, stressed when I don't know if what happened was ocd. It sucks, it makes me feel really bad and the hate, disappointment, sadness to myself only grows. Well it has happened to me a few times, dreams half asleep and half awake. I feel like I'm in control of what I think and I think I am. I am. I want to be sincere, so you don't change your opinion on this. And I dream sexual dreams, Im noticing the sensations it makes me feel. This has already happening three times, but I get over the crisis when I find out that I thought those thoughts on purpose because it was a compulsion of \"checking\", if it is a compulsion it means that it is because of ocd and not because I want those thoughts. So I was in that half awake/sleep state and I had a sexual dream, I had arousal, in the dream I was masturbating, I was thinking about different people because I wanted to climax fast, something like that. So a sexual body part appeared that the related)? with that relative that is why i am stressed out with my life and that I never saw before in that way... I thought that sexual image like a movie, i feel disgusting, with that relative and in that same asleep/awake state I thought something and I noticed that it didn't make me come faster, so I'm sure I thought about it again and there it did make me climax. (When this happened i tried and thought about other people to make me feel the same like the thought of that relative did and I felt that arousal too) I'm not sure if I thought about it twice, but I feel like it did, and if it didn't it's still okay? What do you think? But what I am sure happened was that, that thought of \"it didn't make me climax fast or when I thought about it I didn't feel that (the fast climax), so that's why I'm sure i thought about it twice. SO MY QUESTION IS, was it some kind of compulsion? I know my questions are compulsions too, but I want to know, I can't leave it like that. If I leave it like that I just get even more depressed and just want to die. I have even avoided seeing that family member since before, because I don't want to, the thoughts, all of these... The guilt and hatred I feel for myself only grows, I would self-harm, but I promised never to do it again, once for hitting myself with the corner of the bed my hand was very bruised and in pain, that bruise that remained there served me as a reminder not to hurt myself again, it hurt me a lot to see my body hurt, it also ruined me, I just wanted to stop crying and concentrate on something other than the pain and stress of these thoughts / things that have happened. Also at the same time I try to sympathize a little because I don't want this, it hurts, it feels like I want it, but I wasn't like that before. I guess making a big deal out of it only makes it worse. Come to think of it, I always had an abhorrence for sex, and it's probably because my younger brother's father touched me as a child, plus I was exposed to sexual content as a child. Many times I would start crying because I thought, \"why didn't I stop that man from touching me\" I blamed myself a lot and felt really dirty, disgusting. And well now and since that happened sex made me (still does) very uncomfortable and gave me a weird feeling. So surprise! My thoughts are sexual attacking what matters most to me. My family, a fictional character. Before the sexual thoughts were with that fictional character, I know it's stupid, but I love that character very much and of course, now the focus is with that family member that I love very much. And now it's all over here. I would really like to die, but I can't give that pain to my mother. But it hurts me so so much when she gets worried about me, what would she think if she knew? It hurts me to live, but it would hurt her even more if I died, I don't know. Thank you if you've read this, probably not a big deal to you, but thank you. There is no worse thing than feeling alone. This gives me hope that is ocd because back then I never had this kind of sexual dreams, and half sleep/awake sexual dreams. This started because of this. I also ended up here because yes, I used to test a looot myself while masturbating to see if those thoughts (with that familiar) could make me feel something. I tried many times and then, dreams happened, half awake dreams/dreaming. I would get these sexual thoughts. I felt like I was touching myself while they were there or not pushing them away. And I analyzed a lot, why was that happening, oh because of OCD. Ok, that means it's not the real me. I seem to keep falling into the traps. And well, this has all unfolded up to here. I also don't want to die, because I never asked for this, also maybe I suffer because i feel i deserve it. I can't even feel a moment of happiness because i remember this and tell myself, \"why are you here smiling? You don't deserve it, you need to make sure that what happened was because of ocd, then you can feel happiness, otherwise no!\" it seems very unfair and it makes me angry. Why do I have to go through this? What did I do? I was always helping everyone... that has always been my reason for living, studying and helping others. Helping them to avoid going through what I've been through... really that's the only thing that keeps me here and the small hope that this is because of ocd.",
      "Now I know. Same thing again... I'm kind of upset about myself. Now I'm sure, but feel sad because i couldn't ignore this problem"

      "[23.1., 17:38] leslie: Since I started with this intrusive thoughts thing, it started when I masturbated. I mean, when I did it once, the image of someone I didn't want came to my mind. That's when it all started. It's been 4 years now and now those thoughts are with a family member. I have had many triggers and compulsions. So I hardly ever masturbate, and if I did, I did a thousand things in my mind to control the thought. My mistake was to start checking to see if I felt anything when I masturbated with the image of that family member. I felt horrible, I still feel bad. I never did these things before. That happened many times. What happened today, I would like to know if it is because of all this that happened and because of the ocd. I was masturbating, and of course I thought about the situation that these thoughts come during these moments. At first I was just concentrating on the sensation and getting to climax. Then comes a thought of that familiar's face, which makes me come faster to orgasm, I stopped paying attention to it. It was about 3-5 seconds that it appeared. I didn't stop touching myself, I wanted to climax alone. I should have stopped and redirected to something else. And start again and reach climax not because of that thought. I think also in the back of my mind sexual image appeared, but I didn't pay much attention and thought of another random person. It's not the first time something like this has happened, but it's killing me not knowing. Is this because of ocd? [23.1., 17:46] leslie: The only thing I am sure about is that I NEVER did these things before, nor did they happen to me. In fact, I never thought about people or anything when I masturbated, I just concentrated on the sensation. My question is, that time that intrusive thought appeared that made me climax, I stopped paying attention to it, I wanted to climax, then I think sexual thought appeared at the back of my mind, I didn't pay attention to them, I don't know if it made me feel any sensation, at the end I thought of another random person, it may still be because of the ocd? Am I an incestuous person? Am I bad? I feel very sad. It depresses me not knowing, when I know why it happens, I am relieved and feel happy. I also fear that because I already knew other people had this happen to them, I would reassure myself and say it is still ocd. What if I knew that but took it as an excuse and did these things because I actually like it and not because it is part of ocd? I really feel lost. When I see this family member, I don't feel any sexual or romantic attraction, it really hurts me that this is happening. It depresses me. I know I'm not this, but the fact that I know this and this keeps happening, makes me think I'm actually a disgusting person. I know ocd ignores logic, but I'm confused and lost. I hurt and sometimes feel nothing. I'm just tired and I don't want this anymore. By saying this it seems like I'm lying and that I really want it. It seems like I'm lying and I'm a disgusting person after all. Also my brother had ocd. Contamination ocd. My mom had it too. Do that sometimes gives me hope that this is part of ocd/bc of ocd. I don't know but i fee like alleviated when i tell this to other people that understand ocd. I really hope this is part of ocd and not because I'm using ocd as an excuse and I'm a terrible person",

Thank you very much",
      "Do you have a diagnosis of OCD?",
      "Yes I do it’s severe",
      "Well, far as I know, the only way to stop doing compulsions to to stop doing them. Didn't say it was easy. I always go back to Master Yoda in this forum: Do, or do not.  There is no Try. But that loop has got to be broken.  Sometimes I give into compulsions, and sometimes I make myself not do them.  Like anything, practice makes perfect.  I still battle plenty of compulsions, but by stopping some, I've managed to get rid of some of my more distressing intrusive thoughts.e It's one of those things that you only can do by doing it.  It requires being more pig-headed than your OCD is.  I have to out-stubborn my OCD.  Hardest part is getting started, when your mind is screaming at you that you got to do that compulsion.  Just because it's really hard, doesn't mean it's impossible, though. Have you been prescribed anything for this?  I don't think there's a magic pill, but I'm on 10mg Lexapro (Escitalopram) for general anxiety, and 25-50mg Trazodone for insomnia, and both have been prescribed by doctors off-label for OCD.  OCD's not why I was given them, but I did notice they took some of the edge off the OCD which only makes sense because, anxiety, and it takes a little more to make me start obsessively worrying, than it used to.  Not a cure by any means, and if I'm bound and determined to be all OCD over something I sure can be; but a lot more these days it's just not worth the effort to get myself all worked up.  It comes and goes.",
      "I take Zoloft but I am doing a CT on January 30. My OCD is bigger than me. It makes me shake. It makes me nervous. It makes me scared it makes me feel terrible. It makes me want to throw up and it makes me repeat. It makes me upset it makes me scared. This is likely not right but I am so scared I don’t want to type anymore. I just need help and I want my mind to stop controlling me because I am in control of my life please any help is appreciated.",
      "Perhaps someone else can offer another way of looking at things, but I think it boils down to breaking that fear-obsession-compulsion loop. I used to suffer a lot from Harm themes that would come and go over the years- that's one of the first manifestations of OCD I had as a child, and it made me worry that I was or was about to be demon-possessed.  Over the years, that's become actually a helpful tool.  I viewed my Harm OCD themes as an imp, demon, that lived inside my head as a squatter.  It's got squatter's rights, and I can't evict it.  It eats fear- that's what it lives on.  So then my aim became to give it as little fear (over my intrusive harm thoughts) as I could.  Less fear=less food=weaker=not as able to generate fear.  So the more I could make myself ignore the intrusive thoughts, not give in to compulsions based on the fear I was going to do something terrible, the more I could starve that demon. A more metaphysical and prosaic way of saying what I've already opined in my previous post.  Not easy to start denying the beast the food it needs to stay strong, but baby steps.  Every time you can break that loop and not give in to a compulsion or force yourself to not worry, makes it weaker and makes you stronger. Something that helped me with my intrusive thoughts was making the conscious decision to have an attitude of not caring  I decided I'd worry about harming (translation: killing) the objects of my intrusive thoughts, when I'd actually gone and done it- not before.  I call that 'deferring anxiety'.  The day I actually act out one of my intrusive harm thoughts, I'll have plenty of time then to panic and freak out and go off the deep end.  Until then nothing's happened, and my intrusive thoughts mean nothing.  I defer my anxiety for when the feared thing actually happens.  Until then, it's only that OCD monster wanting a handout that I won't give it.",
      "Hello I posted on here before if anyone has any ideas how to please help me stop my racing mind taunts  me all the time I have to do things and in eights. For example, I have eight songs in my head or eight songs that I need to do I think of one and then another one comes in on its own and then I need to finish the rest it tells me all day long I get to two or three and then my mind says that’s not right, but keep doing it and then it starts back again at one and then I hold my breath until I get it right and it was really start to scaring me because I it is affecting me emotionally and physically very very badly.

      "Hello again! I guess I'm a disgusting, bad person after all. I don't know how to get out of this. Whenever something happens about my ocd theme (if it is hopefully) I want to know what has happened is because of ocd. I really don't know what to do. I want help, but in the country I am in there is no help (ocd specialist) I don't know if it is ocd that I have. Please just tell me if this is part of  ocd. I am desperate, I am getting more and more depressed. I feel so bad, death is all I think about. Sorry again and thanks if you are reading me. The thing is, i woke up in the morning and went back to sleep. Then I was dreaming, I was half asleep and awake. I think i could control what i was thinking in that state. A person appeared in my dream and I was having s*x with that person. But then whenever something sexual happens, thoughts that I don't want with a family member come. And that happened, I wanted to see or I think I paid attention to that, and the same thing happened, the sexual thought now was with that relative. I didn't want to keep thinking about it, I was kind of paying attention to the sensations that it made me feel, the feelings down there (sorry again if this is disgusting), I don't remember if i wanted to know, this whole day u kept analyzing many times to try to remember every detail of this. And then I thought that same sexual thought again with that family member. My fear is that I did it because I like it. I want to know if this was some compulsion or if this is part of  ocd. I really don't know. Or tell me if it's not part of  ocd and it's just my true self after all. I am planning to end everything. This is only getting worse. I think about my mother, what kind of daughter does she have? It hurts me like you have no idea. I feel lost. I'm worried, I'm tired, I feel guilty. I feel like a monster. But it's okay for me to suffer, this is what I deserve. But I think at the same time it's so unfair, I never did anything wrong, I was never like that before and these things didn't happen. I feel disappointed and I hate myself too much. Please tell me if this is part of this disorder or not. Am i a incestuous person? I know I want reassurance, but please. Help me. I don't want this. I never wanted this, all I ever wanted was to have a normal relationship with my brother, not this crap. These horrible thoughts and everything that has happened. I feel like I don't deserve to be cared about. I should be dead and suffering in the worst way possible. -- Tue Jan 09, 2024 6:26 pm -- I hope i dont look like im faking all of this and using ocd as an excuse. Please, tell me? I think I'm faking to feel this way",
      "If I had a dollar for every time someone dreamt the thing they're obsessing over... It only stands to reason if you're obsessively worrying about something, it stands a chance of intruding into your dreams.  Also the people in this forum have shown a remarkable capacity to twist everything to the thing they're obsessing over... because we obsess.  It's what we do.  I can't say whether you have OCD, but you're doing a good job of it if you don't...",
      "I don't know much about OCD other than I get intrusive thoughts that made therapists think maybe I had it (I don't), but generally it seems that when people are stressed about something and that something interferes enough in their life for them to write an anonymous post somewhere about it asking for help, it usually means that what they are going through at least is real and requires some help. The thing about intrusive thoughts is, is that it's not specific to OCD alone. Other disorders experience this too. It's usually in your response and way of dealing with these thoughts that people can figure out if it's OCD or something else. Either way, it's worth checking out with the help of a specialist. Maybe you can find one online? Best of luck! ~ Grey",
      "Thank you both for your answers! The thing is it was kind of a dream but i was half sleep/awake, so it felt and I think it was that i was deciding in the dream. So then when I was fully awake i was trying to feel the same what i fekt in the half asleep/awake dream/thoughts. It kind of worries me. But i saw a person that happened the same to her... I hooe this is bc of ocd.",
      "From the way you're obsessing over it, I suspect it might be OCD related, but I'm not a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist and even if I were, I don't know you well enough. I advise you ask a therapist about it and meanwhile look for advice to deal with intrusive thoughts and obsessions regarding those thoughts."

      "As you can tell, I’ve not been worse or better. It feels the same. I don’t feel any more anxiety or depression that had been plaguing my life, but I only feel is just neutral, like I’m able to stay focused on studies or other stuff with OCD. I’ve not had a treatment before, but I can’t tell if it’s OCD talking or just me overexaggerating.",
      "KidDJ wrote: I’ve not had a treatment before, but I can’t tell if it’s OCD talking or just me overexaggerating. You're taking something for it?  I don't recall offhand.",
      "To give a proper explanation, I've had sessions with a couple of specialists and received no treatment, and no diagnosis a few years before. Now I'm not sure what to actually do, can't say that I'm healed.",
      "Okay.  I thought perhaps you'd been taking something that caused you to feel 'neutral', which I took to mean feeling nothing much.  I know some people feel a depressive (not depression) effect when they are on certain psych meds.  Taking away the lows and highs of emotion, I reckon. Are you feeling any happiness or satisfaction?  Depression is often to my understanding comorbid with anxiety issues.  Depression isn't necessarily feeling distinctly 'sad'- most of my life I've probably met the criteria for depression without realising it.  This might be depression. Are you having any anxiety spikes at all? Seems to be a frequent experience on here that OCD will wear a person out and then they'll be okay for a while or switch themes for a while.  I know my OCD themes would go through- will go through, that is, although I've managed to learn to control some themes- periods where they quieten then eventually grow strong again.  This might be a quiet time.  But I wouldn't discount the idea of actually still having depression.",
      "On some levels, yeah, I still experience normal happiness and satisfaction from time to time. But it's weird that I occasionally have anxiety spikes a few times, but it's not like they cause so much strain and agony, knowing how painful it used be a few years ago.",
      "Weird that they don't cause the agony they did?",
      "I've felt normal throughout this day, so that was unexpected. I don't think I'm having so many negative reactions towards it, but I guess those traumatizing flashbacks will remain for the remainder of my life. I feel fine at least."

      "Hey all, After reading a lot on this forum about HOCD (I know it's better to leave it), I took the step to make my own topic to tell about my situation because I'm literally losing it. I'm 25 years old and this is my story: I'm addicted to gambling, now in recovery for 4,5 months with professional help. For around 8 years I gambled. After 2 months in recovery, out of nowhere there came a sound in my head saying 'You are gay'. I was in bed at night, I didn't know what was happening to me. In my whole life I never got sexually attracted to a boy/men, only by girls and women. I liked them. I don't hate gays, but I just don't want to be it  and I never got those signals. It's been 2 months dealing with those voices in my head and thoughts. My libido is totally gone - don't want to have sex with my girlfriend and also seeing pics of beautiful women does nothing to me. Just no sexual interest comes up which I was always used to and I loved it. Now I just don't want and can't think about it. And when I see a beautiful woman and I'm not turning on, the thought tell me it's because I'm gay. So it's feeling like I'm stuck in a circle. The thoughts are now telling me I want to be gay, maybe because I'm just tired of this situation. But if I imagine accepting being gay, I can't think of really living like a gay. Since my birth until now, I never got sexual attracted by a men. Even when I'm making this message, the thought tells me I was earlier sexual attracted by a men and my relations with girls and sex were all nonsense, that I did it to avoid being gay. Again, I'm starting to losing it. I just don't have any vision that I will come out of this situation and living with this. This + quitting cold turkey with gambling, you can maybe imagine how I'm feeling right now... Needed to get this of my heart. Thanks for who read and maybe reply.",
      "Hi and welcome to the forum. So sorry you're going through this. Did you have an OCD fixation on gambling before the new HOCD fixation? It is common for a person to develop a new OCD fixation after leaving one behind, or for a new one to replace an older fixation. Either way, it sounds clear to me that this is an unwanted intrusive thought you're having. It's understandable that it's affecting your libido, since now an event that would have aroused you before triggers these stresses, worries and feelings. I get the sense that you already know deep down that these are nothing more than intrusive thoughts. Still, to someone who hasn't experienced intrusive thoughts much before, they are extremely alarming. I used to get very disturbing intrusive thoughts, but when I started to let go of worrying about them / reacting to them, they naturally diminished and now happen maybe once every few days at most as a passing thing. Intrusive thoughts don't mean anything. Also, checking to see if you have any kind of response over an OCD fear won't tell you anything either. With OCD, you can expect things that scare you on some level to irrationally pop into your head. Beyond initially thinking on it, ruminating and reassuring yourself over it are only going to make it worse. Checking is only going to make it worse. Unfortunately, in my experience the only thing you can do on your own about it (ie. outside of talking to others, therapy, etc) is to ride out the terrible anxiety and don't change any of your behaviour because of the thoughts. Very hard to do at first, but it gets easier and the OCD fear will lose it's power over you. Also, you can expect something else in the future to pop into your head when you least want it to. So expect it and choose ahead of time not to react to it, or else it will become your next OCD fixation."

      "I’m writing this because I feel hopeless, like I’ve been carrying a lot of mental baggage for a while that I can’t process or make sense of in a healthy way. It just always feels as if there is something off about my experiences/concerns, like a lot of the time “it’s just in my head” and the best thing for me to do is to simply ignore my thoughts. There’s probably some truth to that solution, but it comes at the expense of making me feel empty, invalidated and plain ######6 weird. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had this tendency to overthink, over-complicate and question myself way too much. I was even know as “the thinker” in primary school because I would sit on my own at lunch and entertain myself with my thoughts. Much of my thinking actually wasn’t entertaining though, because I used to worry a lot, in obsessive ways. I know for a fact that I’ve exhibited thought patterns consistent with obsessive compulsive disorder, but there’s also been many instances where none of my mental problems really made sense at all. Without a disorder to attribute to these odd patterns of behaviour, it all just seems like nonsense that didn’t mean anything. I would worry that I was gay for example, but looking back I can’t take this seriously at all, despite the obvious effect that it had on my well-being.   I would think about this obsessively, and I even convinced myself that I was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder despite not being diagnosed. I would legitimately think about being gay for the majority of my day, it seemed like the worst possibility in the world, completely unforgivable. And then the topic would transition to something else, next it was my academic performance. These fixations would have my full attention, literally nothing else mattered and there were constantly new questions that I had to solve. As I said though, none of this stuff seems relevant when I look back on it, I’m actually fighting the urge to stop writing this post because much of it feels exaggerated and pathetic. The obsession with my academics involved compulsive behaviours aimed at reassuring myself that I wouldn’t fail, or something along those lines. These obsessive rituals involved a lot of anxiety, so I also experienced social anxiety problems and had a lot of issues making friends. It was very hard to be present in conversations, and a lot of the time I was just an insecure asshole. Coming back to before and how I was fighting the urge to delete the post, I think a lot of that comes down to the fact that I can’t remember much from this time period - even though this was only a few years ago. I know there was a lot of obsessive compulsive behaviour that I was hyper-fixated on, but there honestly aren’t many details that I can explain in detail. I know that a had a lot of anxiety problems, and that I never really formed any meaningful connections/friendships because I was soo distracted with my obsessive thoughts about my academics. My grades were good, but it was often hard to concentrate because it felt like there was soo much pressure to do well (this would’ve been from the ages of 13-16). Not long before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the topic of my obsessive thoughts shifted to intelligence. My new obsession was intelligence, and the only thing that mattered was whether or not I was gifted. I remember not being able to concentrate on conversations because I was focussing on my ability to solve problems, my grades actually didn’t suffer much because I could use them as evidence/reassurance that I was intelligent. This probably sounds like obsessive compulsive disorder, but I doubt that a lot. I think that even if it was a case of OCD, it would be relatively mild. That’s why I hate myself for all the time that I wasted, I literally wouldn’t leave my room on my holiday breaks because I was too busy finding new IQ tests to complete. It was always the same: yes I finally found it! Evidence that I am intelligent and everything will be OK! But then doubt would start to settle in, I needed to reach another high through reassurance/evidence-seeking. This process was extremely time-consuming, all of this time was “pissed away” completely, years of my life. And it isn’t as if I have a meaningful reason for why this all happened, all of it could have easily been prevented if I’d forced myself to stop, but I didn’t. My theory is that this was a coping mechanism that I developed in childhood, which is really painful to think about because like I said, all of this could have easily  been prevented had I responded to these obsessions like a normal person. My family is also wealthy, so it’s even worse because I had easy access to therapy. The pandemic ended and the topic switched, now I was obsessed about physical attractiveness. I asked tens of thousands of people online about my face, many of the photos even were taken in my school uniform. I stopped completing assignments to ask people online about my face, in class. What’s even worse is that I took legitimate pleasure out of thinking about these obsessions too, I ######6 enjoyed a lot of it. What disgusting person completely neglects their education to obsess about their attractiveness? It is pathetic, especially when combined with the fact that I had more opportunities than 99.5% of people. I’ve had some other obsessions in the past that more closely resembled typical OCD, obsessions about germs or the existence of hell, but I still don’t believe that I ever had the condition. At 18 years old, I am not ready to be an adult at all. I constantly find myself realising that I am more vulnerable than most people, I missed out on much of the growth that 90% of people went through in their teen years. You could tell me all you want that I am exaggerating, but I know this deep down, I can just feel it. Here’s the ###$ up part though, I sabotaged myself through my senior year, my grades were soo bad that one of the exams was listed as “ungraded” on the report card. Honestly, I felt a lot of shame. It was a cycle of self-hatred, I’d feel ashamed and respond by sabotaging myself because it felt like the easy thing to do. Much of this stemmed from the obsessive behaviour involving my physical attractiveness. I remember going onto web chatting platforms when I was 16-17, I would pretend that I was confident in front of younger girls (girls aged as young as 13) and this would give me a sense of sexual validation. Not once did I ever make one of these girls feel uncomfortable, or say anything overly sexual, and I stand by that because it is the truth. I would put on a mask though, and would seek sexual validation because I wanted them to think that I was attractive. I wasn’t sure what sexual validation was to be honest, I only found out later through ChatGPT and it all made sense. But for a while I walked around believing that I was a monster because it really felt like I was communicating/interacting with these younger girls in a sexual way, I felt very ashamed about it and never told anyone. Like I said though, not once did I ever make any advances or act overtly creepy. Anyway, I bottled this up for a while and the shame festered in the back of my mind for a long while. Especially because I’d been obsessed about my attractiveness soo much, the shame compounded even more. After all I’d asked thousands of younger girls to rate my face, what if I was falsely labelled as a paedophile? There were also times too where’d I’d asked for the Snapchat/Instagram or girls as young as 13, I didn’t plan on speaking to them I just wanted validation. This went on for months, like for months I was locked inside my room seeking validation like a degenerate. My face was all over the internet and I felt like a monster because I would sexualise each interaction that I’d have with a girl (even younger ones), my mind was constantly looking for the kind of validation that I spoke about before. But coming back to my senior year, a large reason that I failed was due to paranoia. I was afraid people would catch on to these masks that I would put on, that they’d realise how much of a monster I was deep down. I guess I felt like I had to sabotage myself because it allowed me to avoid all of these mental problems, it was a cop out. I managed to stop relying on the coping mechanism that I had developed. The truth is, I’m not even sure what the real issues behind the obsessive thoughts were, largely because there isn’t really any evidence that anything even happened. It is the greatest mind ###$ of all, legitimately has me questioning whether I’m insane a lot of the time. These days I still worry about things, but it isn’t the same as it used to be. At least before I knew what the problem was, now I just feel like a hollow NPC that can’t connect with anyone. I’m hyper self-aware, hell I even find myself sometimes missing those obsessions that I used to have, at least they gave me a sense of identity and stability. Now, now nothing really makes sense at all. You see I’m writing all this with such confidence, but there’s also a high probability that I’ll leave this feeling like I #######4 95% of it. I hope you guys get the general gist though, I can’t connect with who I was at all, it legitimately feels like I made everything up for a sense of internal validation. It’s just a massive pain because I’m at an age where mental problems are held against you, sure I still have a safety net, but if I go off the rails again there will be legitimate consequences because I’m an adult now. I should also mention that twice now, I’ve done extremely risky things impulsively for a sense of meaning/validation. Whether drinking too much on purpose or dangerous driving, these behaviours gave me a sense of importance. The idea of coming very close to death felt special in a way that I can’t explain, I don’t know if it was the sense of personal significance that led me to do it, or the sense that a near death experience could be transformative. I don’t think these were actual attempts by the way. I’ve told my parents about half of all this, I genuinely feel like it would be impossible to tell them the other half though. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, reading this has meant the world to me.",
      "Wow, that's really horrible. Reading this, I felt like you couldn't hide your mental problems, and for that, you were brave enough to pour everything out. The important thing, is that you have to tell your parents that you're not keeping up with your daily life. Simply tell them that you're having those obsessive thoughts that you have no capable of ignoring, but also, drives you into engaging in compulsive behaviours. I hope you find some peace for yourself. You're going to be okay."

      "Hey, I just wanted to write this somewhere, because if I keep it to myself for too long, I'm afraid it will eventually happen. I've always had a very bad time with intrusive thoughts, and recently there has been this one which makes me very scared, that soon I will lose my mind completely and hurt my little brother, maybe even kill him (for the record, we get along very well and there is no reason I would actually want to do it). That's all.",
      "I've moved this into OCD, because it's very OCD-like.  I used to suffer from having intrusive harm thoughts very like that.  Have you any formal diagnosis?  Not to say you have this or that, but this is a common OCD thing, and family members and pets are the most common things associated with harm thoughts.  You wouldn't know it from all the sexual theme posts here, but really, this kind of thing is common as dirt.  It took me a long time to learn how to disregard such thoughts.  Once you can manage to cop an attitude of not caring 'I'll worry about it when I've done it, not before', then you'd be surprised how much such thoughts lessen.",
      "Hi, Sorry, if I'm getting annoying, but sometimes I just really need to write some bad thoughts off because they are getting onto me and I can't just go to my therapist every day. I'm having a really bad time accepting people's opinions and I tend to go very aggressive when someone doesn't agree with me. There was something I argued about with my mother and we wre on polar opposite opinions. I got very aggressive and shouted all the time. After the fight there were thoughts about me betraying or even killing my family because of the fight, which scared me, and I'm known for acting awfully towards people. Last time I had such a big fight with someone I ended up betraying my best friend by exposing his parallel relationships to his wive. I'm afraid I'm going to lose control of myself and do the unthinkable to my mother/father/brother and I don't want to do it. And I feel that if I keep it to myself, it may happen.",
      "Well, I confess with my personality, I found it mildly shocking about that fight with your friend, and what you did.  But I know people who have a streak like that in them.  That doesn't equate to being murderous, however.  I mean even for someone who might be a little vindictive, that doesn't necessarily mean that they might be prone to violence. For me, the idea of losing control has been a large feature in my experience with intrusive harm thoughts.  The idea that I'd lose control, or black out, or do it in my sleep- for me that's always been my Achilles heel OCD has used to beat me over the head with- I'm going to kill someone- my partner, traditionally- in my sleep.  Like sleepwalking, except it's killing.  It'll wait until I've composed myself for sleep, then it'll sneak up and try to ambush me.  I've learned to disregard such thoughts, and as a result I hardly ever have to deal with them any longer.  It takes practice but it's doable.  It's ceasing to worry about something I can't control.  I haven't a history of losing control and hurting or killing people.  Mere thoughts certainly can't make me do it.  If I go out of my head so bad I do something like that, well, there's no point in worrying over something that hasn't happened yet- I've had many decades to act out to such thoughts, or 'lose control' and do the feared thing, and yet I haven't- so what makes me think it'll happen now?  Nothing.  OCD ain't got nothing but hollow threats that I'll do something horrible.  Once I'd really convinced myself of that, things got a lot better for me.  At some point, I had to stop caring so much about if I'd ever do such a thing or not.  Not going to, so why should I care about these thoughts?  After that, I get thoughts like that only infrequently, and when I do I'm able to ignore them and forget I even had such a thought after only a few minutes, rather than worry and obsess and act on compulsions over them.  Some days it takes a little more effort than others- I've learned to slowly put such thoughts down, and slowly back away from them.  Figuratively speaking.  When I get an intrusive harm thought and I'm particularly vulnerable to anxiety from it, I mentally set that thought down, leave it be, and back off.  It'll go away on its own, because I instinctively know if I chew on that thought even just a little, I'm liable to undo all the progress I've made in learning to ignore them.  I do that also with POCD themed thoughts.  I just mentally shake my head and tell my OCD 'nope not going there.  NOT going there at all!'.  If I don't let myself get started on it, then it can't become a huge anxiety for me.",
      "Thank you for your insight. It feels relieving to be able to compare the experiences of other people. I don't have a diagnosis, but both my therapist and psychiatrist have stressed that I am very much prone to anxiety and prescribed me a couple of tranquilizers (still not seeing the effect but it's been two weeks since I began taking it). As for having control on my thoughts, that's where I fail. I just can't let the thoughts go on and everytime I have one, I become very scared that it might happen and I try to tell it to someone in order to \"prevent\" that. In fact, I've had one thought in the last week that my brother might get killed in a car crash, as someone coming from the side would be too fast and crash in the back door. Most probably it's not going to happen, but still I need to vent somewhere just to be sure.",
      "What have you been prescribed? I take two antidepressants: escitalopram (Lexapro) for general anxiety, and also I've been given trazodone to use as a sleep aid.  In the U.S., both of those are off-label (but common) usages.  I'm not sure what class of drugs trazodone's in, but it's not an SSRI the way Lexapro is. I've read in Europe, escitalopram is prescribed explicitly for OCD, and trazodone is mentioned as being sometimes prescribed for OCD.  As far as my OCD goes, it does seem to me that one or both of those together has taken some of the edge off my OCD.  I used to have severe job anxieties and obsessions, and while I still have them, they've dulled quite a bit.  I went through some job turmoil, and had to change employers, and was idle for a couple years, during which I began taking those medications.  So some of my experience may be due to merely having changed jobs, but I don't think that's all of it, either.  I do think those two meds (minimal doses on each of them) have managed to ease anxiety/depression just enough to at least function without throwing myself into mental histrionics most of the time.",
      "Hi, I'm having the thoughts again, this time it's about the New Year celebrations.  After long talks with my aunt it seems they are not coming to us and instread going to their friends, which means we are staying by ourselves. I'm having this thought that my dad is going to get very drunk and violate us, e.g., force himself on mum and make me and my brother watch, and then kill all of us. He is not violent even when he is drunk, he usually falls asleep, so I don't really have to worry about that, I just wanted to let this off. Happy new year!",
      "Hi, it's me again. Sorry if I'm being annoying, but that's the place where I let my thoughts off. So, yesterday I learned that I am getting a huge heating bill this month and I am very scared. That's because the house I live in is actually family property and my dad gets to know everything about the bills, house, etc. This time I'm scared because I know Dad would be furious when he finds out, and I'm worried it would be too much of a pressure for him. I'm very worried he might have a heart attack and die, because he had blood pressure problems. Once again sorry for the constant nagging but I just need to let these thoughts off.",

      "I've had a problem with sex for years now. I've been addicted to pornography and masturbating and I'm very ashamed and guilty of it. Even still, I end up relapsing and thinking of sexual topics with and without intrusive thoughts. I just can't seem to help it and I don't know what to do. I also have a very very bad time with sleep. It feels like a challenge every night. There's been nights where I've relapsed on porn and masturbation and couldn't sleep for a couple days. At the very worst, it was an escalation relapse and I'll feel extremely guilty and disgusted of myself. A couple of months ago something similar happened when I was masturbating. I got bored of how I usually do it, I got carried away, and impulsively masturbated by rubbing against a filthy wall and to this day I regret it so much. It haunts me that my impulses took me to a place like that and I hate that it happened. I've never done something like that before but I've escalated in other ways with porn on several occasions. It didn't even feel like this is really me when having this addictive problem at times. There's even times where I know relapsing will make things way worse than they already are and I'll still get temptations to do so anyway. I hate this so much. This awful, impulsive act has lead me to be so fearful of my health. Scared of what will happen in the future every single day. When it happened, I ended up feeling a lot worse than I am now and I saw some very unsettling symptoms that thankfully went away. Still though, I'm worried that I contracted some kind of STI or disease by what I've done and I can't shake the feeling that my intrusive thoughts may be right and that I'll die from an illness unexpectedly. I went to get this checked out more then once and I was told that it wasn't a UTI somehow, so I must be fine. I just don't know. I want to stop worrying about this and somehow be kind to myself and not let my addiction get to me. But I just can't help but feel so disgusted by the things I've watched, the things I've escalated to, and the thoughts I have about all of this. I hate that with all this regret, I still get urges and I'm still bothers by thoughts telling me to do it all over again. I'm getting so many intrusive thoughts about my health the second any physical sensation crosses my mind. I get intrusive thoughts about my reproductive health, my respiratory health, my mind, and it never seems to end. I just wish I could go back and prevent the day I was ever exposed to porn. I wish I could just somehow stop it but I can't. This might bothers me forever. I don't know.",

Not at all trying to diminish the problem you're having with porn, but for real, you're being harsh on yourself.  I can't even remember all the ways I've masturbated, seriously some of this is just being a dude.  I'm pretty sure I've stuck Little Snaga in all sorts of places and up against all sorts of things and in plenty of places I shouldn't have played with myself in.  And not just as a teen but well up into adulthood until you just get so old it's like 'this is too much like work'.  Really, I get the porn addiction and not to say it's nothing, because it certainly is something, but some of this is just being a guy.  Because if you have a penis, you're going to see how many ways you can mess with it, it's just part of having a Y chromosome.  I have no facts to back that up with, but I dare someone to honestly prove me wrong.  I have a penis, I'm going to see how many ways I can have fun with it.  You feel as if you're alone in this, but you are so not alone, trust me.  I think the porn and isolating ourselves from interactions with other people exacerbate things like your wall episode, but seriously, you're too hard on yourself. I understand that OCD makes everything seem as if it were insurmountable, but some of this stuff it's really not worth the self-torture you're inflicting on yourself.  We'll focus so hard on self-horror and regret that we make no traction at all.  After a point, it becomes very unhelpful to us to get this extreme with how we feel about ourselves.",
      "Maybe you're right. Maybe OCD is just making this much harder than it actually is. This has happened before but not to the extent of this. It's hard to hold boundaries on what I want out of this sometimes but I do know that porn is only going to make my mental health worse. I think this gave me some sort of infection that I need to check out. I just wish I could stop being hard on myself for it over and over again.",
      "I don't know if I'll keep this thinking for long term but I think the reason why I did this and I'm coming to terms with it now is that I wanted something different. I wanted to try a different way of going about this and that's what I chose. It wasn't a really good move and I regret it but that's what I chose in the moment. I've read in many other replies people have posted elsewhere about this topic and it makes me feel less alone at least. Just hope I can get it checked and treated"

      "This post is probably going to be all over the place so I apologize in advance. Anyway, I've been talking to a girl for a little while now and I think I like her, but I'm also really worried and feel like I don't and I'm just faking it due to compulsory heterosexuality. It really sucks because I don't want to try and go forward with anything if I'm not really straight because I don't want to hurt her or anyone else because of this. Due to all of that I started the bad habit of testing again. I did the usual testing erections to both and then moved on to masturbating to both. I started off with straight porn and didn't really feel anything so I stopped and waited a little bit and then tried the same thing with gay porn and within a minute I felt like orgasming which I ended up doing when I switched to straight porn for a minute. I know testing is bad, but surely a straight male wouldn't have that happen to him right? Like quick orgasms to gay porn, but it feels like a chore to achieve with straight porn. I always dreamt of starting a family and all that, but it just seems like I was deluding myself. Do I seem gay from this? Can OCD even cause this stuff with arousal like that? I'd really appreciate input and I know I need to get help, but I'm so worried that what I'm afraid of is right",
      "If anxiety masturbating to gay porn can cause orgasm then why does it not seem to do the same with straight if I'm using the same anxious thoughts",
      "geasu wrote: If anxiety masturbating to gay porn can cause orgasm then why does it not seem to do the same with straight if I'm using the same anxious thoughts You're not going to get the same reaction out of looking at straight porn because it's truly not the thing causing your anxiety. I honestly don't think testing tells you anything. You could convince yourself of nearly anything by doing testing. In my opinion and experience, with OCD the only way to know is to let it go. Once you've let this fixation go and stopped worrying about it for like a year, then you'll have the clarity to look at it and the answer will be obvious. It sounds impossible to do when you're the one in it, but you won't be able to discern the truth from where you are right now. As an example, for a long time I was fixated on if I had an STD or not. I got tested like 20 times to be sure I didn't, and would question if I had it from all sorts of everyday things. To someone else, they wouldn't understand why I'd even worry about it. But to me, my brain could NOT stop ruminating on the subject and I felt like I couldn't relax or enjoy my life with this doubt gnawing at me constantly. In the end, STD tests, getting reassurance online from medical professionals and reassuring myself only made it worse. The only thing that got me out of it was drawing a hard line; saying I wasn't going to check if I had it for a year, and was going to accept there was a chance that I did have it . This caused a lot of anxiety initially, but then I slowly stopped ruminating on the matter. Eventually my brain rewired itself not to get anxiety reactions on the subject and by the time the year was up I could look at it clearly and see that further checking was just harmful to me mentally and unnecessary. You can't see the solution to the problem while you're still in the problem . Clarity comes from time and distance. (It also comes from living a healthy lifestyle too which affects how you think a lot: exercise, eating well, supplements -magnesium, vitamin D, and watch for no folic acid except for methylated folate in vitamins as this can spike anxiety) For someone on the outside like me, it's the same thing where I look at this and I don't understand why it's bothering you so much. Life is so short does it even matter if you're gay, straight or bisexual? Should it ever cause you any anxiety whatsoever or be ruining your life? In my opinion, I think you should decide to accept that you don't know the answer for certain right now and stop doing any ruminating or checking OF ANY KIND for a long period of time. Don't be afraid to date women in the interim too. I very strongly suspect this is OCD and that if you were actually gay it wouldn't be something you were testing for, it would just be something you inherently know. I think this is the best way to ultimately know the answer and rewire your brain so you don't live in fear of it and constantly ruminate on the matter.",
      "I remember being fixated on getting HIV from a strip club visit for around 7 months and it took my awhile to accept the test results. Also, from the same visit I got turned on and even almost got an orgasm from multiple dances idk if a gay person would. Another troubling thing for me is I often masturbate thinking about the female perspective in porn and imagining what they feel. I even get turned on when the male pornstars penis gets revealed and I'm worried I've been focusing on the guy the whole time and what all I've said means for my sexuality. Also when I was in second grade I can remember kissing another boy I was friends with and I can also remember me and another boy showing genitals. Does this mean anything? As for the anxiety over being gay or even bi I think is mainly coming from living a lie for years.",
      "OCD can grow to be such a devastating thing when people don't put it in check. I stand by my first post and these additional details don't change my opinion, nor will any other small event you later recall. Your issue is OCD, not your sexuality. Even if you knew the answer definitively as to your sexuality I don't think it would bring you long term peace.  If you weren't ruminating on your sexuality, you'd be ruminating on something else. For long term peace of mind you will need to start working on getting a handle on your OCD. To do that you have to stop seeking reassurance for your doubts and stop analyzing every small thing related to your OCD fixation. At least get it to a level where it doesn't invoke a strong reaction in you. It's going to be the hardest thing you've ever done, but in my experience you have to draw a line in the sand and refuse to ruminate on the matter anymore. That means riding out the anxiety without reassurance, letting the thoughts and doubts swim around your head as you go about your day. But in time the noise will get quieter and the anxiety will lessen, and then it will get fairly easy. Until this topic doesn't invoke OCD anxiety in you I doubt you'll ever find the answer anyway, or else you would have found it by now. If you continue to ruminate and check you just strengthen OCD, and will still be checking 10 years from now unless you break the pattern. Nothing you've said makes me convinced you're gay and a lot of your experiences are pretty common. I think your fear should be of losing yourself to OCD, not of 'living a lie' as you said.",
      "So I was on a car ride and I had to sit in the middle with 2 of my friends and after awhile I started to get an erection I hope that doesn't mean anything"

      "Sorry for being here again, but i just feel so sad, so guilty. I can't continue. But yeah, hello!  I have a question. I am having a hard time now noticing what compulsions I have, I want to know so I can not do them. I have also been crying almost every day because of something that happened, they are similar situations. When I mstrbte, thoughts always come to my mind, they are of my main theme. It has happened many times and now often, but now I don't masturbate for the same thing anymore, I don't want to continue in this spiral when horrible thoughts come to my mind. The problem is this: I was so stressed and the damn thoughts kept coming to my mind, it was one after another and the groinal responses wouldn't stop. I was so stressed and fed up, I wanted to get rid of that feeling. So I mstrbted. I was annoyed with this situation and focused on my thing. Then I was concentrating n the feeling. But then I thought something like, \"oh, THOSE thoughts\"  and well, then they showed up, just like they always do. I think i noticed they were not there, I don't remember if I had them present in the back of my mind. Already at the end I had one of those thoughts, so I quickly thought of someone else and then someone else, I didn't want to finish and keep thinking of those thoughts! So it's a compulsion, kind of noticing that the thoughts you don't want are not there and and that itself brings attention to them and bam, you end up thinking them? I feel so down, I know I'm not attracted to this person, but this situation happens and it is so sad and wants me to end everything. Death is all what I think. How can I live while these things happen? But then I think it's better to be alive so I suffer for all this. I deswrve to suffer. I try to have self compassion, but it is so hard when this happens. I feel I don't deserve it. Guilt and depression is killing me",
      "So sorry you're going through this. It can get better. First of all, checking for a groin response or anything like that won't reliably tell you anything when you have OCD and it's about the subject of your intrusive thoughts. With OCD and intrusive thoughts you could convince yourself you're attracted to literally anything that way. So don't do it because it won't tell you anything, and means nothing. If the thought is unwanted, then it's an intrusive thought, and it doesn't say anything about you. You should feel no shame or guilt because of it. It's only popping into your head because you have OCD and the thought terrifies you. If it's terrifying you, it's not truly you. You are going to have to accept that these thoughts have no bearing on your life. That will help you to stop ruminating on the them. The more you ruminate on the thoughts, the deeper you'll go into doubting yourself. Breaking that vicious pattern is an effective way to reduce your OCD and improve your quality of life. And you don't have to do it alone. Sharing this with others makes it easier. So does finding a good therapist, preferably someone who specializes in OCD.",
      "Hello, Catnaps! Thank you so much for your answer. It really means a lot to me. I'm trying to find a specialist, but it is so difficult to find one! And i really hope this is all part of ocd. Im so tired. Im sure im not attracted to this person, it is a fam member. He has a wife and I don't feel jealous at all, I don't look at him and feel deep down, \"oh wow I like you or i feel sexual attraction when I see you\". No! All what I feel is family love... I hate this, but i know i can get better. Thanks again!"

      "I really feel very bad, the only thing I want and think about is to die. Every time I see a car or train passing in front of me I just want to jump out and end this once and for all. How can I go on living after all this. I am a bad, bad, bad person. I don't deserve the people I love to help me. How could they help someone like this. I don't know what I did to make this happen to me. I was always careful not to hurt others and all I wanted was to help others. Why does this have to happen to me? I look back and all I did was help, please others. In my heart there was never a desire to harm others or do things that I consider wrong. God, what did I do? I don't want to die, I don't want to but I don't want to stay, to live. I would like to kill myself the truth, but I think of my mommy, she would not support it, I will not do it because I am afraid, I don't want to die, but I don't want to live like this. I cry for all those who are going through hard times, I cry for the people who are no longer trying to escape the pain, and I cry even more for the person we were before and could have been without any of this having started. I feel lost. It is getting worse and worse. It seems like everything I didn't want, is reality. I know it's not, but it feels real. I know it's not me, but it feels like it is. But what I came to, what has me this bad now was something that happened. Sorry if this is terrible and descriptive, but I want you to give me your honest opinion taking the details well into account, again. It's okay if you think badly of me, I already do, there's nothing left. Help me please, one last time, THIS IS LONG TEXT SO SORRY for my grammar, english is not my first language and i dont want to miss any detail in case you change your op or advice for me. Sorry if this is disgusting, but I was mstrbting and everything was fine, I didn't pay attention to the intrusive thoughts. But the second time I did it I remembered that when you were doing that, (it happens to many people) and thinking about your unwanted thoughts make you to climax faster and that's what happened to me. When I thought that I was mstrbating too and I remembered that and I climaxed faster. But I feel really bad, I shouldn't have done what I did. I wanted to see. I feel like I used the thoughts for pleasure, but i never use people, WAY WORSE family members to \"fantasize\". This is a problem for me bc everytime I was doing that, instrusive thoughts always appeared, at the climax, or before it. Anytime. ALSO I AVOID mastbtng bc of this issue. So I continued, I wanted to climax, but THE PROBLEM IS I didn't push the thoughts away from my mind,  also i didnt want to have them in first place, I think that I continued using them to mstrbate like for pleasure, but NO, i just wanted to reach climax and saw the thoughts there. I waas chasing the feeling. Also the thoughts didn't boost the climax, still im scared. Now i dont remeber things clear. Also a few seconds before I finished I thought of someone else to fix that thought and see if I also could climax faster. I know this isn't me but idk man. I feel guilty and hopeless because it felt I used the thoughts for that $#%^ or that im into that stuff. I just want to know if you have a similar experience and also if you can give me some advice This happened, but as much as I didn't want to know 100% I ended up doing it. This situation happened again, I was mstbting and of course I didn't want those thoughts to come to my mind, I remembered the past situation and I didn't want the same thing to happen, but it happened, so then, I decided to concentrate looking at the walls of my room, I had my cell phone at hand and seeing the walls was not enough, so I saw the random person from a YouTube video, to distract and avoid those thoughts. And I kept going until I reached climax, ALSO these thoughts didn't boost climax. at the end, always at that moment ugly thoughts come and I thought about other people to avoid thinking about my family member. In the end I don't remember if the same thing happened, (if i thought abt that fam member while touching/climaxing) I keep touching myself, my concern is that, I felt that I use the thoughts for pleasure of THAT FAM MEMBER, I REALKY CANT REMEMBER. I try so hard to remember and recreate the scene n my mind but I cant remember. Also a part of me has done it with other people and I don't want to be with them, I try to apply the same with this relative and sometimes I am very calm and convinced, but then comes again the doubt. My head hurts from crying so much, I had overcome it, but now it is back. MY OTHER QUESTION IS, can ocd make you do things you don't want to do, but they are not compulsions? You know it's not real and many people tell you that and you are convinced, but you feel those feelings and they feel real and those things happen, what happened to me! Help please, one last time. I am already looking for an OCD specialist. IMPORTANT: Also i don't see my relative and think, \"oh wow i want to have s*x with you or damn i feel jealous you have someone by your side\" (hes married), HELL NOOO. When I see him its like yay fam member, no romantic/sexual attraction. Thank you sm for your answer -- Sat Dec 02, 2023 10:27 am -- Also I remember and all of this started from checking or testing, idk. I'm so sad.",
      "Hi. I took a quick glance at your other posts because I wanted to confirm what your intrusive thoughts were about - I won't repeat what they are about, because, in a way, it doesn't matter. Every \"theme\" is going to seem real and seem like the worst because it is fueled by anxiety and the panic that comes from it. We have often had members feel like their latest obsession is the worst and wish to return to their previous obsession. But when they do, it becomes the \"worst ever\". The intensity of the anxiety is the reality, not the obsession, thus all obsessions have the same intensity. Anyway, as often happens, when anxiety reaches an extreme, depression can ensue. It seems that is what is happening to you. I don't know where you are or what support is available to you but you need something to help ease the panic you are feeling. I have been where you are many times. It's hard and I feel for you. But that anxiety needs to be turned down, like a flame on a stove.",

      "Right now I’m freaking out. I remember about a few years ago I read a Hentai manga on Reddit, and at the end they mentioned one of the character’s ages as 16. I don’t know why but I read it again at some other point like a week later, but I was bothered by the age, so I never went back. Never downloaded it or anything. I just remember being aroused by it, and now I’m worried I was aroused by CP. Technically that material is illegal in the US, which I was unaware of then. I never thought much of it, but now I feel like a horrible person.",
      "The age of consent is not 18 uniformly across all the regions in the United States. In some, it is 16. Anyway, it's not as if you think about a 17-year-old sexually the day before their birthday makes you a bad person, and then the next day it's different. But I realize that these kinds of rationalizations don't mean much when you are suffering OCD/anxiety. It's going to do what it wants to do. Hope things get better.",

      "Hello all, I am back after 5 years of being off this forum. Some of you might remember me (if you are still here).  For context back in 2017-2018 when I was very active, I had HOCD. Laast year I dealt with harm OCD, but that's long gone. So now, I am dealing with sexual orientation OCD again. Started in January when I got an astrology reading for fun and the astrologer told me I have indications of homosexuality in my chart. I freakeed out a lot. Then I remember watching this cooking show with a very masculine female as the host and I found her very attractive. So that made me wonder, am I gay in addition to the whole astrology fiasco. Fast forward to now, my therpist who I see for non OCD related stuff basically implied I am probably gay and that I need to pay attention to my thoughts because they are there for a reason. So the whole day today I have been online in different forums trying to figure this out. The problem is that my OCD has been very mild this year. I have thoughts but I am able to move on, I'll have momentary anxiety but nothing long lasting. I can't decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I am so scared right now that my therapist was right and that my thoughts are actually trying to tell me I gay.

      "In answer to the question of the title of this post, yes, it can come and go. As anxiety levels go up and down, so do the symptoms of OCD. The higher the level of anxiety, the more intense the expression of OCD symptoms. Also, anxiety isn't something you can gauge solely by \"feeling\" if you have it or not. High levels of anxiety are going to be self-evident and easily perceived. But anxiety can be present and affect our thoughts and behavior even if it doesn't \"feel\" like we have anxiety. Does your non-OCD therapist know you have OCD? I don't know the details of what you said to them but a therapist telling a patient to listen to their thoughts when they suffer OCD is not good advice. The therapist should take things in context and ask the proper questions to assess what is happening. Lastly, as has been said on this forum countless times regarding HOCD, you are not gay if you find the same sexually attractive. I am heterosexual and I find plenty of men attractive (I am a man).

Nice to see you are still here and providing support to people. I did tell my therapist I have OCD in our very first session. She did tell me during our last session when all this happened that she doesn't specalize in OCD. I didn't wanna talk about it but you know with OCD you get these impulses...I just blurted it out and she said \"your thoughts are telling you something and you need to pay attention to them\". I havent been able to get this out of my head and then obviously one thought led to another and then another and i have questioned my whole life, all my past experiences because now everything feels like a sign",

I am so scared right now that my therapist was right and that my thoughts are actually trying to tell me I gay. Just having these thoughts and images that are unwanted makes me gay It's starting to feel so real right now. Hey there. What I'm about to ask is probably a compulsion of my OCD. You started posting in December 2016 and stated you were 19 at the time. You're now 25-26 correct? I'm a 36 year old male that's suffered HOCD since May 2006. I suffered intrusive thoughts that greatly impeded my life from May 2006 until late 2007. My HOCD affected had a moderate to high impact on my life until maybe the Fall of 2022. It ebbs and flows, however, it's weaker now compared to what I endured from 2006-2010. You just can't let it consume you.",
      "I find with OCD you have to be ever vigilant. It's insidious and can creep in during times when you think that you're all good and your OCD is more of a thing of the past. If you start letting OCD dictate your actions again it can come back on really strong, and undo a lot of your progress. It's frustrating, but that's how I've found it to be. I can relate a lot to what you wrote, in that I've had experiences where some event triggered my OCD to doubt if I was right about my conclusions, and then it just so happens that another event causing doubt happens soon after that, which then throws me into an OCD spiral again. OCD can really cause you to read into things way too much or blow things way out of proportion. I wouldn't warp the words of your therapist to mean that they think your thoughts are trying to tell you you're gay. I also wouldn't put any merit in astrology personally. Also, sometimes therapists don't understand what it's like to have OCD. As an example, I have a friend who also has OCD, and my friend had recurring anxiety about the fact that he had got drunk and ended up blacked out in a biker bar one night. His previous therapist told him that 'he'd have to accept the fact that he might have committed horrible crimes with the bikers that night.' If you knew my friend this is genuinely laughable. He would never do anything like that. But this comment almost ruined him. Luckily he knew himself just enough on a deep level to see that there's no way this would be true and eventually got out of it. However you can see how this is exactly the wrong thing to say to a person with OCD who's fixated on something there's basically no chance of. People with OCD tend to look for anything that will confirm their doubts/fears. In the end you know yourself better than anyone. For someone without OCD, I think it makes sense to 'listen to what your thoughts as telling you', but for someone with OCD the advice should be 'you are not your thoughts.' OCD usually comes hand in hand with intrusive thoughts & feelings. If every OCD person paid attention to what their intrusive thoughts were telling them, they'd be convinced they're monsters. If I were you I wouldn't let a few triggering events throw you back into the deep end of OCD. In my experience it's better to refuse to ruminate on it and ride out the anxiety. Then, whenever a triggering event should happen in the future you'll have a better foundation from which to let it drift by without causing you to act on it.",
      "Well it's already been answered in depth but yeah sure.  I know I often use my history of harm OCD themes in the forums to make points to folks and so well here in PF I'm sure I'm pretty well associated with that now.  But it's not as if that's plagued me non-stop since the day it first happened.  I'd go years between flare-ups.  It had gotten to be a very situational thing.  I mean the intrusive thoughts that I'm going to do this or I'm going to do that. Just thinking I inadvertently harmed someone, well I mean I can point to a few days ago for that, ha.  Which reminds me to double-check my dashcam.... Which I'd already forgotten about and now I'll either act on it, or ignore it and after a while I'll forget all about it again.  It's only a problem if I let it be one.  Like catnaps said, once you start giving in to that OCD monster, you can lose ground in a hurry."

      "Ive been having ocd for some time now (especially pocd and contamination ocd) and like sth it keeps sticking on to is this: When I was younger I would rub my genital with my plushies. Didn’t know it was wrong, continued until was 15. Now I keep remembering it and feeling terrible. At first I had the fear it was some fetish even though I never had anything for it specifically (I still sometimes question if I have a fetish but I have 0 symptoms to that). But a few days ago I saw somebody who is almost in the exact same situation as me. But they were afraid they had r4ped the plushie. Now I went through the comment section and all of them said it’s not r4pe bc it’s an object and obviously can’t be traumatised or feel anything since it has no mind, but due to reassure those comments were all deleted and by now the only one that’s left is „would it really be that bad if you had r4ped it?“. And this made me feel bad bc I simply don’t want to be a r4pist. Like yes it wouldn’t have been hurt and it’s not a crime, but the fact that I’d still be a r4pist is just making me want to vomit and end my life. And I know I’m asking for reassurance, but can somebody please tell me if it would have been r4pe?",
      "Hello and welcome! Of course not; it's an object.  Are you ultimately afraid that you would force yourself on a person, by virtue of having done that?"

      "I have written before, but I find myself struggling a lot with POCD or scrupulosity OCD and memories. The fact that I have more than one memory that relates to my worries sometimes convinces me of their importance. For example, I remember years ago, on two separate occasions, masturbating to photo of a television actress, who unbeknownst to me was 15 or 16 in the photos. I had no idea, and this happened when I was anywhere between 16-20 but I just can’t recall. This has been really distressing me lately. I also had a similar incident with a Japanese model who was 17 in a photo I had of her in a bathing suit, and I assumed she was 18. I was 23-24 at the time but I didn’t find out until like years later. I am 36 now but I still think about it. I am a father and this makes me feel like I don’t deserve to be one. Sometimes I’ll remember the checking rituals I had when I was first hit with POCD at 29, like looking at kids in bathing suits and gauging my reactions, sometimes even hoping to find something disturbing so I would know I hated it. Or testing my reactions to disturbing manga. These things too make me feel ashamed. Sometimes I worry that I will never escape the shame. How can I get away from these things? How can I forgive myself? I feel like I don’t deserve the love of my children.",
      "I don't think you need to feel ashamed, but yeah testing is bad- I notice you talk about checking in the past tense.  Checking is bad, bad bad bad because I don't think it tells a person with an obsessional fear a darn thing.  But checking is also something that seems to be just about universal with folks in this forum that have sexual anxiety issues.",
      "Seems like you are on an OCD spiral. I was there about a month ago. This is going to hard to do, but you have to stop digging in your past. Dig in your past and you will find stuff. There's a reason before this you had completely forgotten about it. What helped me dig my way out of it wasn't actually ERP, it was the self compassion work I did in therapy. I see that you say I feel like I don’t deserve the love of my children. How can you rephrase that in a more self compassionate way? Think about how you would respond to your spouse or children if they said the same thing to you. For me, I felt shame for every taboo thought I have ever had. Now, I treat those thoughts as normal experimentation that every human does.",
      "To feel like you don't deserve love because of this is so so incredibly cruel to yourself. To be honest, some women at that age look older, and the age of consent in much of the world is 16. There's a common Hollywood trope of a guy initially interested in a woman he later finds out to be too young for a reason. It's hard to tell sometimes. I would guess that the majority of men worldwide have experienced this at some point. You need to stop thinking of these events as meaning anything about yourself and start thinking of this as an OCD issue. It's likely even that if you do manage to stop ruminating on this you will then turn to something else to ruminate over. OCD doubt can infect your mind to the point where you don't feel like you deserve love. You absolutely must put OCD in check, ride out the anxiety and refuse to ruminate on something you recognize as a rumination. It's very difficult but you owe it to yourself and your loved ones."

I've made some major progress over the past year or so and the obsessive thoughts regarding my orientation have significantly diminished.

It will take time and effort, but you can overcome it.",

I had the same experience where I was able to think about it far more clearly once I put distance between myself and my ruminations. Now be vigilant not to fall back into it again, to fall victim to the illusion that you're all good now and can ruminate on the topic now without concern. It's the same mentality as an addict thinking they now have the self control to start doing drugs again."

      "All of my stupid obsessions relate to my love of anime, which really bums me out. Right now my history with Hentai is really causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I never read or watch extreme stuff, and I used to think I was fairly normal, but not I worry I am a pervert undeserving of love, success, or happiness. Specifically, I am worried about implied ages of characters in manga. I have read many many Hentai manga, often featuring characters in school uniforms as that is part of the appeal to me. Anyway, often times characters will use terms like “senpai” which means a senior peer. Or they say they are a first or second year at “academy” which given the uniforms would mean around 15-17 years old. However they almost never say the ages specifically, and I know in my country, the US, they always change it to 18. Or they will change the setting to like college or something. And thhis is perfectly legal in the US. I can go in Fakku (biggest American Hentai distributor) right now and buy physical or digital copies of these things. However, I have heard it’s more suspect in the UK and Canada, and this is freaking me out. I am also worried that if I am aware of these context cues and still choose to engage or even enjoy something I read, that this makes me a P or even just a bad person. It’s freaking me out. The logic is this: even if it’s not real, the IDEA that these are kids is present or implied, and choosing to fantasize about them is morally, if not exactly legally, the same as engaging in CP. This is truly scaring me and consuming all my thoughts. To me, CP and child abuse are the worst things in the world! Full stop! But now I feel I don’t deserve to be a parent or have a happy family. Part of my brain is screaming that it’s all just cartoons, totally unrealistic, and not to be conflated. At worst it’s ageplay or something like that. But I’m feeling really awful now, and could use some insight. I’m really struggling. I hate having OCD so much.",
      "It seems like you are going through a lot, and I'm really sorry. I know how hard it is, and I'm proud of you for trying to work through this. In my experience, OCD thrives on shame, guilt, anxiety, and fear. Your post is incredibly relatable to me, and it is something I would have written a few months ago. People with OCD can be very obsessed with this idea of being a \"good person.\" Obviously wanting to be a good person is great, but we tend to do this black and white thing where any thing we perceive as being \"bad\" contaminates us. I think this is where the shame comes in, and we tend to ruminate to try and \"solve\" the shame. This is useless. You can't solve anything, and even if you do, OCD will find something new to feel shame over. Guilt is a more useful emotion, and usually indicates if an action aligns with our moral beliefs. However, in OCD this too can become unporportional to the issue at hand, and in my experience usually turns into shame. Then anxiety and fear, or what I call the \"what if\" emotions are typical of OCD.  What if something bad happens? What if I do something bad? These emotions are what exposure response prevention therapy targets. In my experience, these are also the emotions least based in reality. Yes, something bad could happen, something bad could always happen, but for some reason we don't always obsess over it. Mindfullness helps. Being aware of emotions without judging them can help you stand back and observe the actual issue. Some of this also stems from a lack of self confidence. Also, a lot of it stems from negative self talk. Working on these things has really helped me break free from OCD. After I worked on these, I has able to begin working on the fear part, which is really just typical exposure response prevention therapy. Highly unpleasant, but somewhat uncomplicated. Therapy is extremely helpful, especially if you can find a good therapist who specializes in OCD. My therapist literally saved my life, but it took me a few tries to find a therapist who could actually help me. Medication may or may not also be helpful. From my experience, it did not \"cure\" me, but it did help with some of the depression, which gave me motivation and made therapy easier.",

      "Not trying to reassure too much or anything- since reassurance is a very temporary thing- but constantly I'm reminded here just how hard we are on ourselves- an apparent failure on our part to separate what's inside our heads, with our real-world attitudes and behavior towards others.  We conflate fantasy with our real-life behavior and morals.  The two aren't always the same.  Not that I'm particularly into Hentai or Manga, but if I find myself engrossed in a drawing or story, I'm not going to let my OCD play with me over it.  I've largely managed to avoid POCD behaviors by being quick to stomp out any doubts as to being a P.  If I were a P, I'd be doing blatantly P things, or trying to find ways to do them, or feeling despondent that I couldn't do them without getting into trouble, since things that are very obviously P in nature are often illegal, and justifiably so for the most part.  If I ever see anything that I feel crosses the line, well, I don't see it any longer.  But neither do I allow myself to dwell on it, either.  I follow my conscience and the law, and I really don't see how a person can do more than that.  Except that when a person lets their OCD get away with them, then that's not enough, because nothing is ever enough, we have to feel it down in our bones that we're not the least little bit taboo or something.  When we can't be that- we're just human.",
      "I appreciate that. Unfortunately I made myself worse by checking the legality of things in my country, and it’s kind of hit or miss. There is a ton of ambiguity, and I worry about what this means. I couldn’t live with myself if I were a sex offender or something like that.",
      "I'm really sorry, I know how hard this is. I relate to everything you have posted so much. It gets better, but its not a straight path. Your OCD will latch onto new possibilities whenever you feel like you have \"solved\" one. It really sucks. I heard someone say that OCD likes to take possibility as proof that something will happen. Keep in mind that your reality is being distorted by anxiety. Also, give yourself permission not to be perfect. Both in your past actions, your thoughts, and even your responses to OCD. Perfect is literally unattainable. With OCD the important part is progress. Celebrate every time you resist a compulsion and show empathy when you can't. I also was obsessed with the concept of \"sex offender.\" It is probably why POCD and other sexual harm OCD is so common. OCD loves contamination, and the idea that an act can \"contaminate\" you forever with a label is the perfect storm for OCD. There is also lots of ambiguity in sexuality and fear in harming others. Not to reassure you, but most people I know could be on the sex offenders list for something. It's not because they are \"bad people\" or that they are \"dangerous\" (two more phrases that OCD loves). Its just that we are really bad at dealing with sex. You've  got this! Keep responding to those thoughts with \"what happened, happened\"  or \"yes, that could happen.\" You are changing the way your brain works, it will take some time and practice. Be patient with yourself.",

Be patient with yourself. Thank you so much for this. It really is helpful for sure. I struggle so much with this because all I ever wanted was a happy family, and I have that. I have a spouse I love and two wonderful children, and I worry how all of this could effect them? What if I bring shame on them? What if I am a criminal without even knowing it?! How could I face my family or look them in the eyes? These thoughts become inescapable and scary. And every time one of them calms down it seems another rises to take it’s place. It’s pure exhaustion. Aside from that, I feel like I am missing time with my family. They are getting bigger and older and I feel like I have missed so much being stuck in my own head. But it feels like if I don’t solve this then I am being irresponsible, evil even! I swear I have been tempted to turn myself in to the police sometimes, because I feel so guilty I must have done something wrong. It’s so hard. Then there is the shame over my compulsions. I have read or seen things I never would have if I didn’t feel the need to prove to myself that I hate them adequately enough. It’s awful. There are just so many gray areas that I don’t know what I am doing or if something I did ages ago was wrong. Then there is the fact that we as people change over time. Personally I feel the older I get, the more I scrutinize things, especially sexual things, because I don’t want to be a creep. In my twenties or teens I wasn’t nearly so circumspect. This also adds fuel to the fire. My morals have changed drastically even from 3 or 4 years ago. To sum it all up, I’m really tired of trying to see every angle. I wish I could just put it all to rest and move forward, despite everything and anything.",

I know I'm an internet stranger, but I'm actually crying right now because I emphasize so much with the pain you are going through. You are so brave and strong, and you can get through this. Can I call myself a good person? This is all or nothing thinking. Snaga is right, with OCD nothing will ever be enough. You could literally lead the perfect life and OCD will find something to obsess over. It's not a reflection of your worth as a human, only of some unfortunate wiring in your brain."

      "hi. this is gonna be kinda lengthy but i just need to explain everything. i think i cheated on my ex, and i also think i did something gross or weird. i feel really ashamed to say all this and type it all out but i don’t know what to do anymore. i just want some perspective on my situation because i can’t see anything clearly. so, my ex and i have been on and off the past almost 5 years. last year we were broken up but still talking to each other all the time for a few months. it was my idea to keep talking because i couldn’t let him go, and he said he was going to figure out if he wanted to be with me or not. here’s when this whole situation im freaking out about over happens. my step dad has an adopted son that he didn’t speak to for years prior to this. the last time we heard from him is when he lived with us for like 2 years when i was around 10 which is also when my mom and step dad got together. so technically he is my step brother but i never really considered him that for some reason? he was also about 7 years older than me. when he lived with us i did have a crush on him. again, i never considered him as a brother. we didn’t really have that type of relationship when i was a kid. to me it was just like my mom’s boyfriend’s kid was living with us. my mom didn’t really consider him his stepson either so yeah. he was 16 when he moved in with us and was 18 when he moved out i think? so i was 10 when he moved in and 12 when he moved out. did not see him or hear from him at all until last year. he came to visit us last year and i found myself having a crush on him again for some reason? i was 19 then. i wanted him to find me attractive and i enjoyed hanging out with him. i feel so weird and gross for feeling that way towards someone who is supposed to be my step brother. i didn’t flirt with him or do anything with him, it was just something in my head. i’m 99% sure i would have never done anything with him anyways, so i don’t understand why it became a thing. i really didn’t even find him attractive, i guess i just wanted validation but it was like a fantasy not a real life thing? idk how to describe it. if he ever actually expressed interest in me i would feel validated but i would also be grossed out. i feel like it might’ve just been a childhood thing that came back?? idk. i had a lot of issues with self esteem back then so i wanted validation from any guy and he wasn’t really an exception since i never saw him as a brother. i remember being excited to see him every time he visited and i was hoping he found me attractive, it’s like i was always trying to impress him. it really grosses me out now. but around that time my ex and i did get back together, and i think i still had those feelings the few other times he came to visit. i had ocd about this back then too so i tried distancing myself from him because i felt really guilty. and i also felt gross about it and wanted to tell my ex but i never did. i feel like i cheated on my ex, and i also feel like a weird and gross person for thinking of my “step brother” in that way. i feel like if my ex knew he would’ve broken up with me because of who it was. like it’s just so crazy to me and idk why i felt that way. i just feel sick about everything. for some context as to why i decided to not tell my ex: throughout our whole relationship i’ve experienced ocd with him. during our talking stage years ago, i remember i had ocd about having a crush on my step brother when i was little. i told him about it because i felt like i was hiding something and that it was something he should know? i don’t know. he didn’t really care, he probably thought it was weird but he said it’s really not that big of a deal considering the circumstances. i’ve also experienced cheating ocd with him. i would get crushes on guys a lot because like i said i liked validation, and he always told me i never cheated and that i could have crushes, just distance myself and don’t do anything. and to also work on the validation thing. but this was years ago. he was only like 19-20 around this time, so i feel like his opinions definitely have changed throughout the years considering he’s now 23. and obviously it being someone that’s technically my step brother makes it different. i don’t know. i just have a strong urge to tell him everything because we’re talking again. i feel like i’m hiding something if i don’t. what if he wouldn’t wanna continue talking to me if he knew i had a crush on my “step brother” as an adult? and even when we were together. but i know i would be giving into my ocd if i did tell him",
      "Hello and welcome. Well, yeah, it'd be giving into your OCD to 'confess', even though it doesn't sound as if you have anything to confess. Relationship-related OCD is a booger that's for sure.  I think it's natural that we'll always be attracted to others, even when we're with someone.  And well, OCD just sees that as an opportunity to make us doubt our relationships, because doubting is our superpower.  But we're always going to see someone that we feel attraction to, or think is attractive.",

      "The best thing is to keep to open forum- moderators don't always have the time to respond individually, also that defeats the purpose of PF.  I'm willing to wager that whatever it is that's now replaced that as an OCD/anxiety theme, it's not as bad as it feels to you, and it's probably something that's been discussed here before- there really is very little that's new under the sun in this forum. I'm glad you hear you're feeling better about the relationship worries.  I think anything to do with relationships and sex are particularly difficult OCD themes because there's so much grey area.  As a child well up into adulthood, I've had most of my trouble with blatant harm themes (killing others, etc) and I feel really in a way that's a whole lot easier to deal with, than anxieties related to relationships, sexuality, because we're not black/white when it comes to those things.  And OCD really can feed on that sort of ambiguity, no matter how slight it is in reality."

      "Here I am again, m i really need help. 2 weeks ago, i was sitting at the park minding my own business when a lady walked past my car. Instantly my brain was like, 'get out and kill her'. I shook away these thoughts. Then i drove off but my head kept spinning with thoughts- 'did u get out of the car and kill her? drive back and check!' i fought the urge to drive back but i have been freaking out. i want to go to the police to check. my brain keeps telling me that i killed her and forgot. if i seriously did kill her, and the cops come, i will certainly kill myself. i can't go on like this anymore. please help me . can someone who is thinking rationally help me? i would appreciate it. Sue xx",
      "can anyone help please?",
      "Hey, I'm going to assume nothing happened. If you make an attempt on someone's life in a park, it's going to be known and there will be witnesses. Especially if you went to hide the evidence, you wouldn't have gone unnoticed. To get away with something like this takes careful planning. Since you haven't heard anything yet and managed to drive away without issues (other than your own nagging thoughts) it's essentially impossible that you did this. I don't have any advice on dealing with intrusive thoughts like these. An expert can help you out better. Sorry I can't be of more help but I hope you're at least convinced you didn't harm this lady. Take care, ~ Grey/Knight",
      "Hi Triskelion, Thank you for your reply. It means a lot. Sometimes I don't see my ocd as just thoughts, sometimes i can believe them. My psych says that these thoughts are the opposite to who I am. I used to be a checker- iron, oven,stove etc... Now i get these harm ocd thoughts that plague me. Like you said,  there would've been witnesses ,police etc... Somehow i need to distract myself and just let the thoughts talk their sheeit. Thank you again for trying to make sense of my nonsense. Sue xx",
      "Glad I could help you out a little. I know nothing much about ocd. I had some traits when my therapist did a standard personality disorder test, but I immediately knew that ocd doesn't apply to me so I never looked into ways to manage ocd. Does getting a dog help maybe? If you're with your dog in the park, you'll know he'll bark if there's aggression? Then again maybe then you'll start thinking that every bark is a sign you did something wrong ... Tricky. I hope someone with ocd applies to give you some referenced insight. Take care! ~ Grey/Knight",
      "Gotta love that harm OCD. I don't have anything to say, that I haven't said more than once in posts concerning harm intrusive thoughts.  I had to learn to not care about such thoughts.  From everything I've read, Normies get the exact same thoughts .  But they don't obsess over them- it's 'what a weird thought!' and they go about their day.  But not us- we freak out and wonder how we could have ever thought that? I won't say I can reliably refrain from driving back somewhere to check that I didn't hit someone, but as far as the intrusive thoughts, again, I've detailed it before now in this forum.  It's copping an attitude that I'm not going to care about it, until I've actually done it.  When I act on such a thought, then I'll panic.  Not before.  It's deferring my anxiety until there's a reason to be anxious.  Once I decided 'hey I've never killed anyone, so I refuse to care what happens', and I was able to stick to that mindset, it's amazing how quickly my intrusive harm thoughts lessened in frequency and intensity.  Once I'd made up my mind to not take them seriously, their power over me lessened greatly.  No secret magic, it just takes practice and a decision to out-stubborn the OCD.  Which kinda makes sense, if OCD does involve getting stuck in cognitive or mental loops.  Point is, after many years of having bouts of disturbing intrusive harm thoughts, once I'd worked out that despite them I've never killed anyone so why should I worry about it now? combined with a conscious decision to simply not care whether I killed anyone or not (obviously I do care, but it's an attitude thing- I'll worry about it, when I've DONE it, until then I don't care) well, things got way better for me.  At some point, you have to demand your OCD show you the receipts- show me the proof I'm going to be this terrible thing you say I'm going to be or do.  Hasn't happened yet, so why should I listen to you?  that sort of thing.",
      "Thanks Snaga. I woke up yesterday morning with my usual heart racing. I had enough. I went to the hospital.i straight up told them everything, even if I sounded delusional. Pretty much said that my brain is saying I killed someone.but I have forgotten. And if they can please tell me if I have committed a crime, to ket me know since the mental health care team and the police are linked. The RN said , look if ya did something, you would've Been caught by now ( it's been 3 weeks). I'm the same breath, she said that these thoughts are the opposite to who I am. She also reminded me.of the pattern I have with harm ocd to which I.replied that each time I think \" this time it is real'. After a big cry and some fact checking, I was discharged .

But also ,like you said, if I do, I will.worry about it.then. ocd can eff off! We are not murderers Snaga. We are not.out thoughts. Now I need to put all this into practice and not run to the hospital when i get a flare up. I.was even going.to.go to the cops.but they would've just sent me to hospital. They would think I'm nuts especially if they don't know how irrational.ocd can be and hoe.sometimes I believe these thoughts.

      "All of my stupid obsessions relate to my love of anime, which really bums me out. Right now my history with Hentai is really causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I never read or watch extreme stuff, and I used to think I was fairly normal, but not I worry I am a pervert undeserving of love, success, or happiness. Specifically, I am worried about implied ages of characters in manga. I have read many many Hentai manga, often featuring characters in school uniforms as that is part of the appeal to me. Anyway, often times characters will use terms like “senpai” which means a senior peer. Or they say they are a first or second year at “academy” which given the uniforms would mean around 15-17 years old. However they almost never say the ages specifically, and I know in my country, the US, they always change it to 18. Or they will change the setting to like college or something. And thhis is perfectly legal in the US. I can go in Fakku (biggest American Hentai distributor) right now and buy physical or digital copies of these things. However, I have heard it’s more suspect in the UK and Canada, and this is freaking me out. I am also worried that if I am aware of these context cues and still choose to engage or even enjoy something I read, that this makes me a P or even just a bad person. It’s freaking me out. The logic is this: even if it’s not real, the IDEA that these are kids is present or implied, and choosing to fantasize about them is morally, if not exactly legally, the same as engaging in CP. This is truly scaring me and consuming all my thoughts. To me, CP and child abuse are the worst things in the world! Full stop! But now I feel I don’t deserve to be a parent or have a happy family. Part of my brain is screaming that it’s all just cartoons, totally unrealistic, and not to be conflated. At worst it’s ageplay or something like that. But I’m feeling really awful now, and could use some insight. I’m really struggling. I hate having OCD so much.",

      "Bare with me, I have a lot to unpack. I read some disturbing fanfiction as a teen involving children. One time I had a sexual fantasy (maybe a dream) about me as a mother being forced to have sex with a child. My memory is a little fuzzy on that, I think I was sexually aroused by the idea of being forced to do something taboo, and I think I stopped the fantasy or dream. Regardless, I know a one-time fantasy I had as a teen means  nothing. As an adult, I reread the fanfiction that I read as a teen to determine the age of the characters. In most of the fanfiction, the age isn't stated. But now I feel guilt over re-reading the fanfiction. This site will obviously remove any real CSEM that is reported to it, but it allowed authors to embed clips from porn into underage fanfiction, as long as the clips are 18+. I clicked on a few underage fanfictions that had clips to make sure that they were 18+. Obviously I can't know for sure, but now I worry that I viewed CSEM. More worrying to me is the bestiality thoughts I have had. I once considered enticing my dog to lick me inappropriately as a teen. It scares me that I actually thought about doing it. I also read  some bestiality  fanfiction, and looked at some bestiality hentai. A few days ago I again fantasized about having sex with a dog. I think I was just curious. I do worry about \"losing control\" and looking up CSEM, but I know that is just an OCD intrusive thought. I got drunk a few days ago and I worry I looked up something then. I was not blackout drunk, I remember everything I did, and I even left myself a note saying that it didn't happen because I knew it was going to be a trigger for me. Still I worry. That's OCD for ya. What I am more worried about is how other people would see me. I just started a new relationship with someone I actually like for the first time in my life. I don't want them to break up with me  because they think I am a sexual pervert. I don't want to be a sexual pervert. I always thought I was normal, but all the research I have been reading says that less than 2 percent of the population has ever had a sexual fantasy about children, and only around 7 percent with animals. Which means I am a pervert. I just can't imagine life alone, without a family, that's all I want out of life. But with my perversions I don't know if I deserve that. I try to remind myself that I everything I looked at was fictional, but what if those images in the fanfictions weren't of age? What if I did look up something while I was drunk? And I know that those thoughts are OCD. I know that I have to live with the fact that they might be true. I just can't, because if they are true, then I don't know how to forgive myself. I know I could just not tell the person I am dating. But I feel like this is something they HAVE to know about me. I think because I am worried that someday I might \"lose control\" and do something bad. And that I keep thinking of myself as a pervert who doesn't deserve them.",
      "Welcome. Have you ever been diagnosed with OCD or any other anxiety disorder? Are you much older than a teenager now (you don't have to state your age). I ask because you said certain fantasies and other things happened when you were a teen. From what I read, there seem to be two distinctions that can be made. One, you have some issues regarding sexual fantasy, and your overall self-image (sexually). I am not saying if these things are right or wrong but you are at odds with yourself about it - that is where the \"issue\" is. Two, you have anxiety issues that might be caused by your concerns about your sexual fantasies, or you have stand-alone anxiety issues (such as neurological), and your concerns are being used as fuel to worsen your anxiety. This is how it works (in general) with those of us who suffer from OCD. Do you see a therapist? A therapist will be able to untangle and isolate the two and also show you how/why they are tangled. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered to get a better understanding of what is going on. Regarding discussing this with your partner - if you have not been dating them for a good deal of time it might be too difficult to ascertain if you can really trust them to be sensitive to your needs.",
      "I have been diagnosed with OCD. Most of the stuff that happened when I was a teenager was about 6 years ago. I honestly forgot about it until about 5 months ago, and now I can't stop obsessing about it.",
      "I have realized through obsessive rumination that all the fanfiction I read about bestiality included an element of being forced. Ie, the person involved in the situation is forced into the act of bestiality. For me, maybe I was just attracted to the humiliation aspect of being forced into something taboo? None of this matters to me, because more than being worried about actually being a pedophile or actually being attracted to animals, I am worried about being alone. I am worried about my loved ones leaving me. I feel the most guilt over making sure that the clips in the fanfiction were of age, because if they weren't, I could have been contributing to the abuse of minors. I feel guilt over fantasizing about the dog, because she is innocent. Just thinking about victimizing an animal makes me feel sick, and I can't believe I allowed myself to fantasize about that. Same with the fantasy I had last week. I don't know why I allowed myself to think that. I feel some guilt over the fanfiction I have read in the past, but only a little, because I know that the fanfiction did not actually harm anyone. More than the guilt, I struggle with the idea of being rejected if people knew. I am scared my boyfriend would break up with me, that my family would reject me, that I would be jailed, in-prisoned, registered, and have to spend the rest of my life alone. I have always assumed that I was normal, that my experiences with fanfiction was normal, and that the few \"weird\" fantasies I had were just the normal experimentation that everyone does. I would say most of the fantasies I have are very typical for women. However, after researching fantasies and reading online posts, I realize that I am not normal.",
      "Being normal or \"not normal\" is not like a light switch. It is not one or the other. Also, what is normal or what is not, is subjective. Plenty of teen or older people have taboo fantasies. If it is affecting your behavior in the real world or it is stopping you from living a quality life then it needs to be addressed. Knowing you have been diagnosed with OCD a lot of what you said, and how it is processed is not unlike many others who have posted here. You are not alone in your concerns. ShameGuiltGoober wrote: I honestly forgot about it until about 5 months ago, and now I can't stop obsessing about it. This tells me, and probably every other person who suffers OCD, that your anxiety is using your past to make things worse for you. Do you see a therapist? Do you see a psychiatrist? Are you taking meds?",
      "Updating this for anyone in a similar boat. One thing I learned in therapy is to have self-compassion. I wish I didn't read such taboo stuff as a teenager, but part of being a teenager is to explore your sexuality in weird ways. Part of being a human is having weird thoughts, and trying to determine if those thoughts are part of who are or not. Its okay to have weird fantasies and decide that they aren't something that you actually enjoy. Its okay to have weird fantasies that you enjoy and don't want to engage in. OCD likes to put things into black and white categories. It is possible to have \"abnormal\" sexual fantasies and not be a pervert. There is room for grey. Also, people lie, a lot, even to themselves. You might not be as abnormal as you think."

I also read up on problematic fanfictions and indulging in very problematic pairings but I remind myself that fiction doesn't equal reality. I've been squicked by the fictional taboo and learned to accept that I am ok with it. That I do not enjoy those things in real life. I'm not sure where I'm going with this but please don't be hard on yourself for reading that fanfiction and you're not a bad person. You DO deserve happiness and it's ok to feel the way you do but not to the point that it becomes debilitating. You must think \"You know what? Yeah, I read it. The past is in the past\". Cheers!",

I didn’t even really care for the story, but I put myself in place of the kid, almost like an age play fantasy or something. I didn’t masturbate to the story or anything, but I feel abjectly terrible that I did this. I remember just being bored, or something. I can remember one other incident years before the one I describe above featuring the same characters. I don’t remember what I was thinking, but now I feel ashamed and like I don’t ever deserve happiness again. How can I overcome the guilt and shame of these memories, these fleeting events in the past? Please, someone help me. Hey, man. I'm sorry that you feel this way towards yourself. I also read up on problematic fanfictions and indulging in very problematic pairings but I remind myself that fiction doesn't equal reality. I've been squicked by the fictional taboo and learned to accept that I am ok with it. That I do not enjoy those things in real life. I'm not sure where I'm going with this but please don't be hard on yourself for reading that fanfiction and you're not a bad person.

I know. It just is so against my core values. At the time it felt like such a total non-event. I dunno, it probably still is. I think I might also be blowing it WAY out of proportion. I need to live in the now, but the parts of my past I am not proud of are so, I dunno, loud I guess. Why can’t happiness be so persistent, ya know?"

      "I've had POCD and other forms of OCD I began to have intrusive thoughts of masturbating in the same room as my younger brother who was asleep when he was 6—8. We were in seperate beds. I would have not made any noise. I often looked after my younger brother and put him to bed. I only have memories of that one instance and nothing else and it's what kick started my POCD. I have no idea on whether this event actually occurred or not, and whether it's actually a false memory. At the time I was scared of being arrested and charged for it and still am to this day as well as feeling immense guilt. I was in the midst of an eating disorder where I was obsessed with trying to gain weight and the stress would make me vomit after every meal. I was struggling to keep anything down. *mod edit* I was in an incel discord server (I am a femcel—an unattractive woman who's never had any kind of relationship experience). It was a bad place filled with lots of bad people and I wasn’t myself in that environment. I have BPD and it's as if I was possessed or manic in that environment. I was sending nude pictures of my breasts to lots of people because I wanted validation and attention. I would ask people if they wanted to see my boobs and if they said yes I'd send them a picture. Every time I got a good response it felt like a high. Everyone I sent pictures to was 18 and up but there was one guy who I asked if he wanted to see my breasts and I didn't know what age he was. He said yes but I never sent the picture as I just didn't want to. Afterwards I discovered he was 17. My POCD often warps this memory telling me he was younger and/or that I had sent the picture. I was on TikTok and people were talking about some videos that had gone viral of some influencers and from the description it sounded weird, hence why it had gone viral. A LOT of people were talking about it. I can't remember if I knew if it was of a sexual nature or not, earnestly. What I didn't know was the age of the person in the videos. In the comments on one of the TikToks someone linked a Twitter account that had the videos. There were two. In the first it was clear the person was masturbating whilst clothed and once I realised what it was I didn't watch that one. I watched the second video in which the person did the strange behavior that made the video go viral in the first place. They were naked and basically filmed their butt including the hole and smacked it. I watched out of morbid curiosity to see what people were talking about as they were making fun of the person and calling them gay and felt instant regret which I know does not excuse my actions. I don't actually know how old the person was but they were a male and could have been anywhere from 14—16. I know some other adults also watched the video which again doesn’t excuse my actions. In my country viewing content of that nature of anyone under 18 is illegal. I neither downloaded nor shared the video. The other bad thing is that also when on TikTok a video had gone viral again. This time there was very little description and again someone posted the account in the comments. On looking up the video within seconds I realised it was 2 teens having sex (could have been anywhere from 15—17) and immediately exited. I was very upset that the situation had happened again and I vowed to no longer look up videos unless I know what they're about. Again I neither downloaded nor shared the video. Nothing of that nature has happened since. I did not seek out the videos based on the premise that the people in the video were underage, I simply wanted to know what people were talking about. I have been reading up on a website which contains the details of sex offenders who've been convicted of looking up indecent imagery as well as indecent actions with minors that contain details of their crimes and I simply can't fathom their actions. I don't feel like I'm like those people at all. If the police were to know of these particular situations it's unlikely I'd go to prison but I'd be cautioned and have to go on the sex offenders list for 2 years which would ruin everything. I have lots of neices and nephews and already don't see them regularly because of my POCD. If I get in trouble I won't be allowed to be around them which would make the POCD worse as it would affirm the belief that I'm dangerous and can't be around kids. Family members would also want to know why it is that I can't be around children and I'd essentially be blacklisted from the family. I doubt my family would ever trust me to be around their children after such a thing which I would be completely understanding of. Anyone reading is probably wondering why I'm panicking now and not when the events occurred. I have a habit of repressing my emotions and at the time that these two things happened I was being intimidated and harassed by a neighbor (unrelated) and that took up most of my focus. I think the memory of both things have popped up into my head over the years, not in a reminiscing over the content way but in an acknowledgement that that's what I had seen and subsequent guilt. When that happened I tried to simply tell myself that it wasn't that bad for the above reasons i.e. the fact that other adults had watched the first one and the fact that I exited out of the other video once I knew what it was. The way my OCD works (I have various themes as well as POCD) is that it will fixate on a subject from anywhere from hours to days to weeks then move on to another subject. These two events are my current fixation especially as I feel they have the potential to ruin my life. I feel disgusting and that I have to reveal these things to every person I meet in life otherwise I feel like I would be deceiving them. I've never been in a relationship and feel like I never will be because of these things. I've had few friends in life and currently have none and feel I can't have any more. I'm scared I will go to prison over the videos and the situation with my brother. In general my POCD makes me feel out of touch with reality as I can never tell what's real or isn't and it warps the things I believe to be true. My POCD mainly centers around false memories. I feel like I'm an unreliable narrator and don't know what's going on in my own head. I can't remember the person I used to be before I had OCD although I know I was unhappy because life has always been stressful, and ever since I've had OCD my gauge on morality has been all over the place. I try to have a neutral view on most things because I have a condition that twists my mind and to be accepting of what it does to my brain feels to be accepting that I'm a bad person. I believe in the psychodynamic theory of OCD; that it stems from inward subconscious beliefs that translates into conscious thoughts and behaviours and I feel that I've always felt disgusting and this core feeling of disgust has formed the basis of various forms of my OCD. My contamination OCD started with me washing my hands with bleach as a teen because I had discovered masturbation and felt dirty and felt like I was spreading my bodily fluids on people. I'm unattractive and have been bullied frequently throughout life. I'm tall for a woman, have small breasts and no curves. I've never felt feminine and up until very recently would never wear skirts or dresses or nail varnish because it would make me feel physically nauseous. When I wear these things I feel disgusting and perverse. I've been treated like I'm disgusting especially growing up by my peers because I deviate from beauty standards. I also think I have ADHD or Autism. It doesn't explain or excuse my actions but I think it can make sense of the way I think and some of the odd things I do. I have severe executive dysfunction which I also had as a child but got better in my teens before getting bad again as an adult. I have so many issues going on it's hard to establish cause and effect. I just feel terrible and like my life is over. I feel suicidal and like I'm a burden on my family and that they'd be better off without me. I'm just tired.",
      "Hello, and welcome! I've moved your post from the original destination, to OCD- I feel as if this is very much about the OCD, and think it fits better in this forum.  From the outside looking in, I just don't see the reasons for remorse or guilt- except of course, OCD.  That's reason enough for how you're feeling about this. Honestly, I see little in what you wrote that would give me pause if it were me in the story- definitely don't think you a bad person!  The masturbation episode with your brother in the room can be summed up in the word 'adolescent'.  The 17 year old, well, you didn't send the photo.  It's not as if you were intentionally trying to target someone under 18. I'm honestly not trying to reassure you here- I stopped doing much in the way of reassurance long ago in this forum- reassurance is cotton candy- it tastes good but isn't nourishing.  But I mean just saying that I don't think there's much to see here as far as any kind of proof you're terrible.  Far from it. I hadn't heard about the Psychodynamic theory of OCD.  I'm not too keen on it as I read the description- that inner conflicts such as aggression or sexual conflicts vs social constraints cause OCD behaviour.  Now, if you just are saying that you thought yourself disgusting and that caused your OCD, yeah I don't know.  I'm more in the Biological camp.  I practically emerged from the womb with anxiety issues, and after a mystery infection at a very young age, well, I've been slightly neurotic ever since.  And there are some theories involving strep/strep-like infections and OCD behaviours.  Also while I'm still OCD, I am on an SSRI for general anxiety and I've noticed I don't have quite the OCD spikes I used to, even though OCD wasn't even in the conversation with my GP. By the way, if I'm reading it right about executive dysfunction, I can sympathise.  But then I am pretty sure I'm ADD- I'll leave the 'hyperactive' out of it- that implies bouncing off the walls, and I was never that.  And it was worse as a child- having to stay late after school to finish my tasks was a regular occurrence with me.  Mind you, this was the start of the 1970s and pumping the kiddos full of Ritalin wasn't a thing yet, so undiagnosed, unmedicated, I dodged that fad. I regret the quiet nature of most of the forums here these days- but in regards to your self-image the moderator in me would mention we do have a BDD forum if you want to post about that subject in there.  One thing I'll say without getting too off-topic for OCD is that from teenagehood well into adulthood I had a very poor self-image and feeling of attractiveness.  With age I partly at least got over it, although I'm sure I still have some very deep seated ideas that girls (I have a pee-pee) find me disgusting or unattractive- which is demonstrably not true, but it's hard to rid oneself of things that were either hammered into us (or we hammered into ourselves, I suspect usually a combination of both) in the adolescent years. Worried36848 wrote: I just feel terrible and like my life is over. I feel suicidal and like I'm a burden on my family and that they'd be better off without me. I'm just tired. Very OCD.  In my opinion.  Take what I write with a grain of salt.  When my anxiety spikes, well, I get suicidal ideation free with my breakfast cereal.  Most of the time it's just so much white noise to me.  Those feelings are as common as dirt in the OCD forum, thinking we may as well kill ourselves is like an OCD superpower.  I think it just comes from this desire to escape our brains and run away from everything, not a genuine suicidal tendency.  If it was, half this forum would be dead.  I can (and have) thought the same or similar things all day long and yet I'm still here.  I think you know your family would be devastated, hurt- I honestly can't think of anything more hurtful and selfish- even hateful on a certain level- than suicide.  I think that last bit- I'm just tired- says a lot about why those thoughts would come to you.  I mean, with OCD we're all-or-nothing and we automatically seem to go to the extreme conclusion, the worst outcome, the most extreme remedy.  In our minds, anyway. Have you spoken with anyone about all this?  Therapist?  General practitioner?"

      "Hypothetical scenario, help please Hi. I've been doing much better lately with these terrible thoughts! I can finally say it wasn't me hahah. But this is so unfair. why is it that when I'm already getting better another thought comes to me? I was there thinking about smth and everything sexual or romantic (which was a case where a man cheated on his wife and I saw some pic the mistress sent to the husband) thought I have ocd distort and turn it to people who are family members. So when I was thinking about that, a thought came and it was like, \"if your brother was not your brother, would you be attracted to him,\" \"would you like to have a romantic or sexual relationship?\" I don't know why it happened to me. I was so scared that I started crying and I couldn't help but analyze it. I tried to be logical. In the middle of the analysis I felt that I would like to have a relationship if we were not related, the ######6 I don't want this, I will never do this. But then I analyzed again and I didn't like it. Why???? I don't want this. I feel so depressed and guilty. I was analyzing to see if I could like it and one time I liked it but then I keep analyzing and I felt like I was going to like it. I don't want to like it. Before this I never had this #######5 thoughts. I never had incestuous thoughts. I see family as family and also friends who are like family.What can I do? I can't take it. If he wasn't my family, would I want to have a romantic or sexual relationship with him? And in checking and analyzing I felt like I might like him, but then I didn't, I felt disgust. Idk man. Help me please. How can I keep living like this, I'm so tired. I'd rather be killed in the worst way possible as long as none of these things happen and that I hate with all my being the suffering of any living being. But I'd rather that than all these #######5 thoughts.HOW CAN I LUVE W THIS",
      "Im okay now. It so hard to dont engage with these thoughts bc they feel so real and i jave that need to be 100% certain",
      "You don't want to be 100% certain. You want to be 1000% certain.  A million percent.  A certainty beyond The Universe.  We crave that absoluteness, but it's not there to be had.  I can't decide if anxiety disorders are like a drug, or if it's the reassurance in the case of OCD that is so much like a drug.  But either way I've wryly noted to myself that we behave a lot like we're addicted to something.  I know that's not necessarily true but we sure can't let go of the thoughts even though we just torture ourselves with them. Want that certainty, and I think that's why sexual OCD themes are so pernicious.  Sexuality and desires are so fuzzy sometimes.  Someone can be 99-44/100 percent they are not something (in this case, incestuous) and you're going to chew on that remaining tiniest of slivers, because that's just how we roll. For me, I think the thing is to decide to not care too much about this.  Which is a conscious decision that required effort and practice.  I mean, if I had a sister and she was attractive, well, being related doesn't make that go away, you know?  And people being what they are, there's going to be times it crosses my mind, or I have a dream, or something Freudian slips past the filters.  But that doesn't mean anything, it doesn't have to mean anything, and if I had a serious paraphilia going on, well I'd know it, and if I have to think and think OCD style about it, then probably the answer is no, and then it means something only if I let it.  So I have to try to not let it. I've never really had POCD, but that's a good example because it's something I have to keep a firm hand on, lest I start to doubt myself every time I touch a child.  I know it's there, it's tickling my OCD, it really wants me to go crazy with that line of thinking, but I just don't let myself go there.  I can't.  I have to stay a step ahead of it and remind myself it's all bullcrap.",

      "I didnt want tl come again here but i feel so down. I'm going to be a bit graphic and I'm sorry, but I want you to understand what has happened and give me an answer with the details in mind. I already want to know if what I feel is real and take away any hope I have. I was sleeping, dreaming that I was m##turbating. I felt it was a somewhat long dream, it felt real. During the whole dream I was doing that. But then I feel like I was conscious, I woke up and I was squeezing my legs to climax, that was in real life. In the dream, I was squeezing my legs, I couldn't finish. But I kind of went back to sleep and kept dreaming, and I was squeezing my legs. Again, I just wanted to climax. In my dreams, when I do that, images always pop up that I don't want, it's me fighting in the dream against those intrusive thoughts and doing compulsions in the dream. And then, (I don't know if I was dreaming at all or I was half awake/asleep) I purposely thought about my main subject of intrusive thoughts, because I wanted to see if I felt something, and I feel a strong groinal, but i didnt do it for sexual purposes and thinking that image was very graphic... it was all fast, and I was all aroused (bc of the dream I was mastbt then that image) and kept squeezing my legs bc I wanted to climax and I did all that happend when i was half awake... idk man.I didn't think that would happen or did I? I mean that strong groinal. It was all confusing, I wasn't fully awake. I felt a little anxiety idk, in the dream, the thought didn't feel bad, I knew it shouldn't, but I thought. It was also like I didn't care I had that disgusting thought, I was half awake/sleep and just wanted to release that tension (climax). why? I don't know and I want to kill myself for it. Also ive noticed when my bladder is full that smtimss happens. Sorry for my English, not my first language. You know the worst part, I don't even feel bad anymore, just sad. I have become so desensitized to the thoughts that I don't feel bad anymore, I just feel very sad and want to end it all. I don't want to live like this anymore. It's all so confusing, I know it's not me, but why does it keep happening? I'm so tired, and about the thoughts I've already learned not to do compulsions when they appear. Yes, I'm still a little afraid of sleeping and dreaming about things like that, I pretend not to be afraid, I guess my mistake is to give a lot of importance to these things and analyze why they happen, I always keep doing a little bit of compulsions. It was going well, I overcame something, but now new theme. It's funny. I feel very bad. Still I'm sure it's not me, I've never been like that, all this $#%^ started with those damn thoughts, I wish I hadn't done those rituals, it's only gotten worse. Before it was sexual focus, now romantic, fear of having romantic or sexual attraction, it's my brother. Just yesterday I cried a lot, I feel sad because we went on a family trip and I feel so rejected, so bad about myself. I'm very shy, I don't socialize at all, I'm boring, I'm very quiet and that makes me feel bad. The horrible thoughts and the way I am have me very depressed. I'm really not happy, not at all. And having these horrible thoughts make it even harder.It's horrible because I never asked for this, I never wanted to be this, think this, feel this. It's just not fair. To anyone who suffers from these things. I'm so sorry, I know how it feels. I also feel like this is real. My biggest fear is already real and I'm so tired it feels like I'm accepting it, but I know, I've never been so sure in my life, that this is not me, but I keep doubting and feeling like it's me. I am 50/50. Please give me an answer if indeed my worst fear came true or what. If it's still ocd I'm going to keep fighting, but if it's not, well, idk. I feel so empty. I would like some advice, something... Please and thank you. I hope you are well. Update: now I feel guilty and very sad",
      "Hope you're doing better with this OCD issue as well. You truly need to stop looking to see if there's arousal when these thoughts pop in. You could so easily manipulate yourself into believing something is true about yourself. With OCD doubt is such a powerful force that you can come to doubt very concrete things. With OCD it would be easy when looking for something in yourself to convince yourself it's true. This checking to see if you're having some kind of response to intrusive thoughts is a terrible habit that you need to break. You owe it to yourself to break out of this cycle. An intrusive thought is just that - intruding on your mind. And it will continue to intrude on your mind as long as you react to it and fear it. Breaking out of that cycle will help you greatly. All the best!",
      "Hello, catnaps! Thanks for your answer. I didn't know j was doing checking compulsions. Till now. It felt automatic and I didn't feel it was a compulsions. I was really worried, now I'm worried about a thought I had. Idk, this is terrible",
      "You are not your thoughts or feelings that pop into your head (ESPECIALLY for someone with OCD). You are what you truly believe deep down and nothing else. An intrusive feeling is not who you are. If a thought or feeling concerns you that it's true, then that's a good sign that it's not. If it was true then would it really scare you so much? For example, if you were truly racist, would a racist feeling that popped into your head really concern you? With OCD you can expect the things you doubt and fear to pop into your head and intrude on your thoughts. Have you looked into OCD / Anxiety disorders much?",
      "I confess to having woken up masturbating to taboo sexual themes, and I refuse to allow it to make me anxious .  Even if I half-consciously continue.  And why?  because it's just a dream.  Not anything I'd do in the Real World, or wish to do.  We have all sorts of little Freudian things in our heads and sometimes they peek out, but they're not the last word on who we are, and how we really behave.  I'd be very easy for my OCD to get hold of things like that, if I let it .  So I don't let it.  I just leave it be and pretty soon I've forgotten about the whole thing.",
      "Catnaps and Snaga! Thank you so much for your answers! I really appreciate it. Hope you both have a good day/night. Tysm!",

      "I'm a seventeen year old girl and I've been experiencing HOCD thoughts since a year (actually, I've realized that I've been having intrusive thoughts centered on my sexuality since I was probably thirteen, without knowing it was HOCD). I'm confident about my sexuality, which is straight, but it has been months since I've been experiencing discomfort/sadness regarding intrusive thoughts about being bi/lesbian (Note that I've had OCD since I was very little, around the age of six-seven. Plus, I've had HOCD thoughts about being demisexual, pansexual, aromantic, asexual and/or trasgender, so basically about most sexual orientations in the community). Since I was little I've always had huge attraction towards guys, already having crushes and making up scenarios with them. Also while experiencing HOCD, I've never been comfortable with the thought of having a romantic or sexual relationship with a girl. I've discovered about different sexualities when I was thirteen, when a friend introduced me to the LGBT community. Since then, I already knew I would have been an ally, but I could not identify with them at all. Around that age I've also started masturbating, watching different types of porn and reading smut. Whenever I'm not in the act of masturbating (where I basically find myself losing touch with reality) I have sexual fantasies just about the opposite sex, enjoying them very much and totally feeling the moment. Whenever I masturbate tho, well, I have every sort of fantasy, some of them which I find disgusting and not in alignement with what I feel whenever the arousal ends (I have/had straight fantasies, wlw, mlm, with eldery people, relatives, teachers, me as the opposite gender, even children twice). The sensation I feel whenever I have the latter(s) is feeling like being drudged or drunk, even if I've never experienced either yet. Like, it feels like I'm in a bubble that is much different from reality. This especially happens with lesbian fantasies: after the masturbation, I usually find myself questioning what attracted me to it in the first place, since I don't find it particulary alluring (I don't read wlw or support actual ships like mlm ones since I don't feel paticulary engaged. Whenever I have those fantasies, I also feel like not actually focusing on women's bodies, but mostly on the sexual act itself (so never imagining kissing or any sort of affection during the act), which doesn't happend whenever I'm having straight or gay (man on man) fantasies. Also, a thing that I noticed (weirdly) thanks to my OCD is that I have lesbian/strange sexual fantasies only after an already existint arousal caused by a straight fantasy or because of anxiety. Another thing is that, especially if watching lesbian porn, I would wander \"these women really are enjoying it, do they actually love the woman body that much?\". Also, sometimes lesbian fantasies would come in as intrusive thoughts while I'm already masturbating to a straight one, making me feel discontent, since it comes to a point that I have to oblige myself into searching lesbian content for reaching an orgasm, even tho I don't want to. When I was around thirteen, I would also install fictional dating apps (like otome games, anime dating games or sort) mostly with men love interests, but sometimes even with women. I would, tho, immediately lose interest in women after the arousal was finished, which led me to find them boring and not for me in a relatively short amount of time. I would also have lesbian sexual fantasies with friends of mine, despite having none attraction towards them in real life. I also started to feel there was something \"obliging\" myself to check out every girl/woman I saw and enjoy what I saw, even if in reality I didn't feel anything apart from feeling kind of puzzled (I think my HOCD started here) Despite already knowing these fantasies are probably just kinks or fantasies inspired by the intrusive thoughts, I'm still scared of might being bisexual or lesbian. My HOCD became worse in september 2022 and led me to not wanting to go to swimming to avoid the changing rooms, checking out every girl costantly, always questioning whether or not I had repressed romantic feelings for every single friend/classmate of mine, all of this while I was having a huge crush on a boy I really loved, moreover. During these months I've experienced thoughts that have never crossed my mind and that led me through depression and a short period of eating much less than usual due to anxiety, such as wanting a romantic and sexual connection with a girl (thoughts that make me gag and feel disgusted, to not mention crying. I've also had a panick attack once). Also, I would usually pay little attention to women in general, like in books or series, just cause I find guys more appealing and interestint. But if I find a woman with a strong personality that I could identify with or want to be like, my mind would istantly go \"you must like her, you are just denyint it\". I've noticed my HOCD becomes worse whenever I'm with LGBT friends. Like, my best friend has come out to me as bisexual, and of course I support her, she's one of my closest friends, I adore her. But she usually \"jokes\", as she says, asking questions such as \"can I see your body?\" or \"why wouldn't you engage in activities with me? You might discover to be bisexual or lesbian\". The worst thing is that HOCD makes me wanna accept whenever she asks those sort of things, even if I know I would not enjoy it. I've been touched by this friend just once last year, she groped my breasts and I did the same to her. Whenever I remember this, I don't feel absolutely anything apart from discomfort (and also kind of regret cause I could have done that with one of her brothers instead). Sometimes HOCD feels so real, that I feel like just accepting it and giving up. It makes me wanna come out, even tho I actually have no attraction/feelings towards the same sex. It also makes me think the opposite sex is unattractive, something that is absolutely NOT what I would usually think. It is also ruining connections with the opposite sex, I've been missing some chances cause I was in the loop of thinking \"Am I liking him or is it just a cover so I don't have to be lesbian?\". I feel bad for liking boys, I feel bad for wanting something with them, all because of HOCD. Now, a thought that usually comes into my mind is \"But guys and girls are all people, there is not difference between the genders, why are you not comfortable with both?\" when I fully know it is insane. (Same as a copule of my favourites: \"but LGBT people might hate me if they know I'm both Christian and straight? Am I too boring since I'm straight?\" Or \"If I highly value my mother and love her, does it mean I'm lesbian?\", \"If I appreciate my own body and its features, am I lesbian?\") Like, I feel ashamed for my earlier teen self that approached sex in such an unhealthy way, feeling like I ruined my possible future relationships with the opposite sex. I questioned  my sexuality different types, but not cause it was something that came natural to me, but because of \"but if I have these fantasies even tho I feel nothing towards women, would people still think I'm bi?\" (Curiosity, I've tried to take tests, they all say I'm either straight or bicurious, but still the questions asked would not take into account the one taking the test might have OCD, so the results might not be accurate). I've also been to therapy, and the therapist has come to the conclusion that I'm in a loop of obsessive thoughts and influences from other people that make me question anything, not just my sexuality. I just want to know if it gets better, or if I'm already gay but denying it, or if I'll suddenly change sexuality randomly one day of my life. I'm also scared God might want me to be gay and that I'm fighting against His choice, I'm scared I'll never have proper relationships with guys. I'm scared of ruining my life by accepting something that I highly feel I'm not. I've also been experiencing self harm OCD, suicide OCD, religious OCD and relationship OCD, also along with obsessive thoughts about my morality and whether or not I'm a good person or not. Even about my hobbies and friendships! I would question every single thing in my life, and the worst thing is that the therapist said I already have all the clues to overcome OCD in general, but I still find it difficult to. (Also sorry for some possible mistakes, my first language is not English)",
      "Hi Lyv, I hope you're doing alright. It definitely sounds like OCD. It seems like you're ruminating about everything in your life that has to do with this topic. It's great that you're seeing a therapist. And I will say that OCD can definitely get better. I think you'll always have OCD tendencies, however it's very much something that can be mitigated - but it takes work to understand yourself, how your brain works, how OCD can both help and hinder you, and how to get out of cyclical OCD loops in thinking. Sometimes, for myself, it helps if I address what the fear is underlying all the OCD ruminations. What is the true source of the anxiety if you follow it all the way down? From there you can start to understand why you're obsessing over certain topics and addressing that underlying fear. Also, just please be kind to yourself. It sounds like you're torturing yourself over this. Would you do that to someone else in your situation? Or would you tell someone else to let it go?"

      "Hi, I really tried. I decided not to engage with many thoughts about my theme. But this one felt very hard to ignore. Why does it have to be like this? I have trouble with dreams, they are sexual. Today I have been having thoughts and one came to my mind that was like this, \"to have the sexual dreams or sexual thoughts so I can enjoy them/have them without guilt\" and not like this in the day which gives me a lot of stress and sadness. It was like a wish, as if it came from my true self. I don't remember the details well, I don't know, man. What was that? It felt real, like I wanted it, very genuine. Why? Obviously I don't want to keep having these thoughts and dreams. What do I do, please tell me if this is a symptom or not. I am so tired. Theres no day i don't cry, for this and other things",
      "I find that dreams can be a thing desired, a thing feared, or just a thing that's been on my mind lately.",
      "I remember something after analyzing, in my dreams or half awake can't remember 100% but i had this exact same thought and I start to worried and it showed later in the day too. And I worried when i was sleeping and i tried to not to engage but i still did a little.",
      "Snaga wrote: I find that dreams can be a thing desired, a thing feared, or just a thing that's been on my mind lately. But i dont desire that... im worried",
      "The OCD mind can trick you into believing all sort of things that aren't true. This can be evident in looking back at something you used to be OCD about (if the subject of your OCD has ever changed). If you think back on it, you can usually see clearly that you were overly worried about something that was wildly unlikely or untrue. But then that's not always the case either, it reallly depends what your OCD is focused around. Even if the above isn't the case for you, basically, who you truly are isn't a thought that pops into your head. There are literal books written on this subject. When it comes to OCD: You are not your thoughts. For example, even people without OCD will sometimes get bitter, resentful or hateful thoughts/feelings that pop into their head - but it's also not what they believe or who they are or want to be, so they dismiss the thought or feeling. People with OCD hold onto that thought/feeling and have a lot of fear and doubt that 'what if this thought is me / true about me?' They ruminate on it, which makes you scared of it being true and the thoughts come in more and more, and get harder and harder to dismiss. The doubt grows that maybe this terrible thing about yourself is true, and so a cycle of doubt and reassurance starts. I feel like you probably already know that this thing you're worried about is not true. Though it's way harder to know that when you're tired or spiralling out in anxiety. In this circumstance it's literally a dream you're worried about. Which is just the brain randomly firing at night. I've had so many messed up and disturbing dreams that if I questioned if they said something about me I'd think I was a monster. In my experience and those of my friends, the first step to get out of this is to understand it. I'd urge you to read up more on OCD & Anxiety, and try to anticipate the traps your brain will fall into. In my experience it takes a lot of discipline and sitting through horrible anxiety without acting on it to re-train your brain out of bad habits and OCD patterns, but it's so worth it in the end. Hope you're doing well.",
      "Hello Catnaps! I really appreciate your answer. Im going to learn more about these conditions, thank you so so much. I've been better lately but then another new thought came! Hypothetical scenario... im trying to let it go, but it's so difficult. Thank you so much again!",
      "Glad I could help! With OCD there will always be a new thought, doubt, hypothetical scenario - but you can get to the point where these thoughts roll off your back more and more and your reaction to them is less and less. It is EXTREMELY difficult at first. But I promise it will get easier in time. Just know that each time you push through the anxiety is a big win over your OCD and sets your future self up for success.",
      "What catnaps said. My harm OCD thoughts only ceased to be an issue when I learned to not care about getting them.  And it's very very hard at first.  There's nothing magical about it, it takes practice.  And constant exercising.  All it would take for me to let something worry me just a little... and some things still do get to me.  But the things I've managed to whup, I am vigilant against."

      "This might be all over the place because *mod edit* but decided that because of how much it’s related to anxiety, distress, Pocd, hocd, it’s more fitting here, so gonna paste some bits. I’m not sure if the moderators will allow it here, but please understand this is not paraphilia related. Please read further into this post, to understand the pocd aspect. First, regarding porn. why does it feel so impossible to not give in, and feels easy/tempting to do again, even though we always have a choice in the present moment to do what’s right. How many times have I repeatedly made the same mistakes, and then posted it on here afterwards? How many times have I gone against my word, re-committed, felt motivated, clean, forgiven, and redeemed, only to give in over and over, binge, then repeat the cycle. After swearing pornography off for good, knowing how it’s been manipulating my own morals, thoughts, motivations, desires in an unhealthy, unwanted way Btw, PMO means: Porn + Masturbation + Orgasm Escalated to fetishes and content like bdsm, bbc, gangbangs, squirting, fisting, tiny teen, 18, petite, asian, cum, jav, etc. Only until after pmo’ing does the full on intensity/realization of anxiety, disgust, panic, guilt, shame, settle in. During the use I know it’s wrong, but when mixed with arousal it makes me feel like I’m kind of enjoying it, even though I’m not. Currently I can’t look at anyone, I can’t look at myself in the mirror. I don’t recognize who I am right now. I can’t even think properly, and can’t even breathe properly. The constant anxiety, intrusive thoughts, questioning, overthinking and guilt feels overpowering. I’m so scared, I’m so shocked, I feel like dying. I feel so corrupted, tainted, and unworthy of love. Feels like I’ve ###$ my life up permanently over this pocd/intrusive thoughts/teen porn situation. It’s been feeling like a dark cloud following me that I can’t shake off, like I’ve scarred myself for life, even though I hope it was temporary, and hope I’ll forget it, not let it control me, and never do any of those type of things again, especially when those intrusive thoughts come up. Porn has caused me to convincingly feel like I really am the absolutely WORST, EVIL, most ###$ up/unwanted things that I’m truly completely the opposite of, and would never do. I’m not a pedophile at ALL, and never in my life would I have thought I would ever feel the need to even say those words, but this whole #####& has caused me to feel like one, even though I do not want to be one ever. Look at the teen stuff I’ve talked about, the intrusive thoughts that come along with it, and how it’s showing up in real life. Also, I’m really not gay or bi yet look at all the bbc, ts, femboy, traps, noticing/focusing on dicks lately, perspective/sensation on how the girl’s possibly feeling, cum fetish stuff I’ve talked about. This is to far, how did I let myself get to this point. POCD and HOCD is at an all time #####&. Knowing all this, how tf could I have possibly given in again. It gets worse with every pmo session or reset. Porn makes ocd (pure-o) way worse. To the point of suicidal ideation, de-realization, numbness, and anxiety to the max Especially POCD, due to what happens when I’ve viewed teen/petite genres where regardless even though the girl is attractive, sexy, seducing, alluring, beautiful, and an adult, I still instantly notice that some of them are TOO small to the point where they look underage and younger than teens, and I get intrusive thoughts. The most ###$ up one was today, during one video (not saying her name here as it’ll trigger some people) I saw her, and compared to the size of the guy *mod edit* was like TF. Since she was very very petite, I think (don’t really remember) that I either thought or silently worded with my mouth non-chalantly and instantaneously like it meant nothing: “Oh wow she looks so small like a literal kid/young girl” then continued in full on arousal/pmo mode like it meant nothing. Resulted in taboo, shock arousal, etc. The people who produce/advertise that type of content know wtf they’re doing. It’s not some healthy fantasy that they’re “legally” producing. They know her body is small like a child, and it’s a fact that predators and pedophiles are prevalent in that industry. Tell me why they portrayed that same girl with pigtails and a pouting face, and made it seem like she was a kid being scolded by an adult? why in some videos she’s playing with bubbles? Idk any adults that play with bubbles. And the ###$ up detail that bothered me was that, after the first pmo session yday, I knew something was up with that video when I said she kinda looked too young and too small. So, after obsessing about it, I went back for reassurance, clicked on the thumbnail and boom. there were a couple coloured kids toys on the couch next to her while she was getting ###$. Why? You tell me, what you think. The intrusive thoughts that came up were there because of all those factors tied. Now bear in mind, that girl is not a kid at all. She’s around my age now, and had to have been minimum 18 during that video, since it’s from one of those popular mainstream companies… Edit: I wanted to “clarify her age” to feel relief in knowing I’m not a creep or predator (risky behaviour) so I just quickly searched it up, didnt see images, just read the date on google search where the links are, and it’s trippy because she has the EXACT same birthday as me, except is 1 year younger, 2001 instead of 2000… In the pmo session(s) it seems I don’t care about it or reflect/analyze the process of thoughts that had arised until after busting, and then I get intrusive thoughts like: Did I enjoy that? Why did that type of thought arise while pmo’ing or even just looking at a girl in general? What does it mean? Was I aroused because she looked like a kid? Did I subconsciously fantasize that girl to fit the type of themes that the intrusive thoughts were saying? Does this have anything to do with intrusive thoughts at all? Am I in denial? Do I even have ocd? Am I a good, loving human being? Am I possessed by a demon? How did I get to this point? Is this even porn escalation? Will I ever be healed from this? Have I hit a point of no return?…. Thoughts like that. Irrational fears, but they feel real because of the ###$ ups and shituations I keep putting myself in. Which results in embeding and reinforcing them with each ###$ up/everytime urges are given into. I can’t even remember what was real and what wasn’t. It’s clear that I’m addicted to porn rn, and I’ve “failed” multiple reboots one after the other. Enough is enough. How many times have I said enough is enough, that’s it, lol. I will get through this, I know this as god is my witness and it’s our divine right to experience freedom from #####& that can be avoided based off our decisions and actions. These type of things are in our hands, and we can make a difference. The end result/consequences of our own actions can either be perceived as positive or negative, you decide. I will not allow any slips, because I know what just one peek will do to me. I knew I was gonna pmo 30 mins before I even was conscious of doing it. Then as I walked to the washroom I knew this feeling as I’ve done it like this many times, it’s a toxic cycle. I was aware I was gonna regret it, and that it wouldn’t be worth it. I remember after the 1st or 2nd session today, I looked up in the washroom and said so sadly why, why, just stop, please why am I pmo’ing again, i need to stop. But that wasn’t enough. A little while later I was right back in it again. It’s like the decision was already made. Once the first search on google images of that girl was made (in the washroom, red flag) I was lostttt, full on lost, taken over, drooling, beating off to pixels on a screen of beautiful women, in sexual provocative contexts, super aroused, then I wanted to see explicit videos/images instead of just the clothed, ahegao faces, cleavage and bikini stuff. Horrible decision that was, as I know that anytime I’m in that situation it always ends with full on pmo then regret, then binge, then finally reflecting on what I just did. Rinse-repeat. I’m ending the cycle for good, because I can’t handle this any longer. This pornography+Pure OCD specifically pocd/hocs $#%^ is like dark black hole evil energy rippling negativity and destruction like a butterfly effect towards every aspect of my being. I can’t ###$ myself up like this any longer, especially after today and the thoughts that came up, plus $#%^ I watched, plus acts I did. I was a spineless, pathetic, loser. In less than 6 months I’ll be 24. I’ve been hooked on this $#%^ since 8 years old, and it’s only been getting worse, and worse, escalating/moving into even more dangerous territories I WOULD NEVER act upon, would never truly enjoy, or do in real life. That porn $#%^/mindset and ego-dystonic behaviours/intrusive thoughts are now showing up some ways in real life, and sometimes I think it’s made me think something along the lines like I feel like I’m “fine” with it or that I “enjoyed” it, but I swear I ######6 don’t. No joke. I’m writing this with certainty, from a place of being grounded and with pure conviction. I’m not writing out my intrusive thoughts. These journals and words help me express how I feel, whilst knowing that the intrusive thoughts/unwanted feelings are not innate and don’t define me or my desires. Is this what addictions do? Warp you, manipulate you, and destroy you to the point where you’re feeling fragmented like a husk/shell. This $#%^ is crazy. An example I resonate with, is organically from an energetic pov, originally being like a pure angelic being , that’s having/had fallen-angelic satanic demonic experiences. Once slightly corrupted/fallen, one can always rehabilitate and redeem themselves, and heal for good. There is no point of no return, and it’s never too late. There’s more In detail I wanna add on that emphasizes and clearly shows signs of Pure-Ocd, and describes a little more about these situations but I’ll save that for later in the comments probably. Side notes : Pure-O Subtypes and description of mental issues I’m experiencing (Self-Diagnosed btw): POCD, HOCD, Intrusive thoughts, Unwanted feelings/sensations, groinal responses, Distorted perceptions, False motivations and False desires - Struggling to heal from porn addiction for good right now, in a toxic cycle that consists of binging, escalating, suicidal ideation, reassurance seeking online in forums, compulsions in my head, mentally saying and sometimes even whispering MULTIPLE times in a day: I’m not gay, I’m not bi, I’m not a pedophile. I’m a heterosexual man and happily always will be” “ I’m not gay”, “ I’m not bi” “I’m not a pedo” “###$ you intrusive thoughts” “###$ off” “Shut the ###$ up” …. Thoughts like that are just a few",
      "UniqueJustLikeYou wrote: It’s clear that I’m addicted to porn Yes, you are. UniqueJustLikeYou wrote: Is this what addictions do? Warp you, manipulate you, and destroy you to the point where you’re feeling fragmented like a husk/shell. Yes, very much so. I'm not sure if you have any other issues besides porn addiction and anxiety so we will address these two things only (and there really isn't much to address in a post). Porn and anxiety go hand in hand perfectly. You will find MANY posts here with that combination. Porn relieves (momentarily) anxiety and then LOADS you up with more. And so it becomes a vicious cycle. The more you watch the more taboo things you need to be involved with to get off. If you can find a therapist to handle the porn and anxiety issues that would be great."

      "Hi, I just want to know if I have POCD or not. When I was taking Dexedrine in particular (but possibly Adderall instead at times) and in a terrible depression, I basically would use it to get high a lot of the time and feel euphoria, but I kept taking it because I felt it was the only way for me to control my ADHD symptoms and it would let me forget my troubles. But when I was taking it, it twisted my sexuality. In my early 20s, I would use the internet and check out pictures of teen girls from their social media – I never did this when I wasn’t using the drug. I used a website where people that are genuine pedophiles would also do this. At the time I thought it was harmless. While masturbating, I would sometimes rotate the pictures so that I’d look at even young girls like around age 8 possibly, and think about them. But after I stopped using the drug and possibly when my depression also improved, I stopped doing that. I don’t do that anymore and think all of this is absolutely vile. Sometimes due to my life being so terrible and not being able to function, I felt the need to take the drug only to do work, but the sexuality wasn’t twisted anymore. I didn’t want to use the website or even think about girls like that. Also, when in the presence of children, even back then, I wouldn’t and currently don’t feel attracted at all – sometimes I have intrusive thoughts but not actual sexual attraction. I’m being treated for OCD and have classic symptoms for it like the need to repeatedly wash hands and be germ free, and to repeatedly check if the front door is locked at night or if the stove is off. And all my psychiatrists act as if I have OCD even though I don’t believe I’ve ever been formally diagnosed. I think my sexuality was also twisted because back then, I had never even kissed a girl before when I was young or kissed a woman when I was a young man, let alone had sex with a woman. I think this screwed up my psychology and contributed to me doing this. I didn’t have much positivity in my life back then either – I couldn’t hold a job, didn’t have friends, and lived with my parents. I don’t use the drug anymore though, and have switched. I don’t need it anymore and have no plans to take it again. However, at one point when I was a kid like age 12, I thought about exposing myself to a girl who was 9-10 that was in my bible study class that my parents would take me to at the local church. She would go to the back sometimes to do work for the teacher and I thought about doing it then, and would sometimes get up to, but I never did, and I think if I actually went up to her, I wouldn’t do it even if we were alone and in close proximity back then because it wouldn’t feel right – however at the time it felt like I did want to, I just don’t think I would back then or now, if I put myself there with her alone. My opinion is that the hormones during that time confused me, and that the drug I was taking in adulthood brought that confusion back. I never did anything at all to anyone and know all this is evil, and I don’t have any intention of ever doing anything like that ever again, or worse. I know it’s terrible and I’m completely against it. Even when using porn, if the people look too young, or could possibly be too young, I don’t watch, even if they’re labeled as 18. And sometimes in real life, when with kids, I get intrusive thoughts about sexuality or their bodies but I don’t want that at all. Lately that’s been going away. If I had a switch, I would use it and turn all of this off for good. All this said, I’ve never knowingly watched child porn videos or images. Even years ago when I was taking Dexedrine, that is a line I would never cross. I’m genuinely sorry about all of this. It’s terrible and a complete stain on my character. But what am I? Do I have POCD? Or is it something else? And do you think I should tell anyone about any of this, ever? Like anyone I get close to – a close friend or a potential partner? I’d feel guilty if I didn’t tell them, otherwise. How guilty should I feel about all this?",
      "There is nothing in what you wrote that indicates you are a Pedophile. From what I have read in this forum - and I have read a LOT of POCD threads - POCD has a very direct and easily spotted set of expressions (symptoms).

But it can also express itself in many different ways, changing all the time. I'm sorry that therapists have been judgemental in the past. You have a lot going on. Maybe look for a new therapist. My fear is that you will go on and on, chasing your tail. The hardest part of these kinds of disorders is getting ahead of the symptoms rather than being trapped inside them. I have never met someone who can \"think\" their way out of severe anxiety. It always takes a healthy plan and then executing that plan and remaining faithful to it."

      "I don't have this feeling that you satisfied with what you know.  It used to be years ago.  When someone with ocd is told to \"just move on instead of dwelling on things\", I try to move on, but I still feel the same feeling like I'm focused on my thoughts and it feels impossible to let go of. I seem to live the thoughts. Also I'm kind of checking if I \"continued\" or if I'm stuck in thoughts. Then I try to tell myself \"Okay, just let go and don't try to concentrate on the thoughts\" and sometimes it's making me feel more grounded. How can I let go? I'm being aware in the exact moment how my consciousness is changing and how I'm getting a new feeling, but in the background I'm kind of afraid that the focus will return to the previous state. Sometimes I try to hold the situation/conciseness where you are not focused in thoughts and I feel not focused on what is in front of me (like watching a TV show). I want feel that my understanding of what is right and wrong is enough for me.  I am currently aware that the point is to be satisfied with your knowledge and not look for more certainty. Just \"do you know it's morning? Yes\" This information is enough for you. And when I really direct myself to settle for it, I feel satisfied and more grounded(less doubt clouds). The point is how to make it permanent. Because my automaton is not to be satisfied with my knowledge. I need to be aware of my every thought of dissatisfaction, define it in your head \"what makes me feel dissatisfied right now\" and try to understand the situation in such a way that \"my understanding is enough for me\". Or even initiate an intention that my understanding is enough for me, for example to sit down and think that it is morning and my understanding is enough for me. It feels a relief. But I'm currently in doubt with whether it's a correct practice or a \"ritual\" to feel better. what do you think?",
      "I'm sorry this is a little hard to follow, do you think you can clarify what you mean? There are a lot of techniques for dealing with OCD and often people have to find what works for them. I think the first step in understanding the traps you can fall into, so that you can avoid them. Another essential part of it I have found is working out and eating well. It sounds reductive and annoying to say it, but it truly changes your state of mind. Flipping your shower to cold for a minute each morning too is great for boosting dopamine for up to 8 hours in a day. It's not a cure but it could being your OCD from an 8 to a 5, which could be the breaking point of being able to manage it or not, at least in my experience."

      "PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SOMEONE ANSWER For info: I'm diagnosed with OCD Like one year ago I was struggling with harm intrusive thoughts involving my older sister. I have had several breakdowns bc of that and was terrified of being alone with her. But now I am freaking out because I think I once considered giving in when the intrusive thoughts started. I remember once she was sleeping next to me and she breathed weirdly and I was wondering whether or not I liked that and then I has the thought \"Should I?\" and considered it for some milisecs. I am now ruminating about whether or not I truly wanted to harm her. I have never harmed her though and never was about to nor had fantasies about it. But this fear of \"Did I genuinely want to hurt her?\" eats me up. Please help me! In case someone is wondering what I did when I had the thoughts. I tried to just sleep and then I went to the bathroom. I generally think I tried to distract myself but on the next day I had a mental breakdown at home bc I kept having these harm thoughts.",
      "Weird thoughts like that are more common than we think.  It's my understanding everyone gets thoughts like that, everyone .  It means nothing.  Normies understand that, and slough it off, but we tend to glom onto them and overthink it to death. I've had OCD with an emphasis on harm thoughts from childhood, and I've found the best way to deal with it is to make myself not care about the thoughts, and also not act on any compulsion to prevent the thought from being acted out.  It's only a big deal, when I let it become one.  It's hard to do at first because your mind will come up with all kinds of excuses to be afraid of yourself, but with practice it gets easier.  I rarely have intrusive intentional harm thoughts that cause me distress, because I have learned to not allow them to distress me.  Now, I need more work on unintentional harm fears, but that's another critter from this.  I would say, once you start making yourself not care about intrusive harm thoughts, it's one of the easiest things to overcome.  Maybe because this sort of thing comes under the classification of 'Pure-O', but it really comes down to a mind game and I had to be more stubborn than the intrusive thoughts."

      "Hello everyone, I am 18 years old. I just created an account here bc I'm feeling so guilty and down. I have been having obsessive thoughts since 2020. I experienced several themes, harm, health (fear of having cancer) and sexual ocd, I guess. The one that has lasted the longest is sexual theme. I would switch from one theme to another, first I would be with the health one and then I would \"get over it\" and then the sexual theme would come, I would get over it and go back to the health one, it was a cycle. Since the end of the year I have had a really bad time, because now I only have sexual obsessions with a relative that I admire and respect a lot, one of the most important people. Also with a fictional character (it's stupid, I know and I'm sorry) but I love that character very much and it's like he's me, I identify with him. Before, he was the focus of attention with sexual thoughts about his person, and with him I experienced for the first time the famous groinal response, that day was one of the worst. I tried to check if I felt the groinal response again and many times I felt it, I also tried to replicate it with other people, but more with that family member to see if I felt it too, and few times I felt it. I think that now I overcame the obsession with the fictional character, I remember that I used to test myself to see if I got groinal with him or not. Now the problem is my relative, he is my older brother. I have something that when I masturbate, sexual images or no sexual of my brother come to my mind, and no matter how much I don't want to think about them, they always come. So I think them, bc it seems impossible to not think abt them so I modify his image and turn him into another person or he becomes a shadow and that shadow is me. I control the image because I always had that fear that his image would come out of nowhere and make me feel more aroused, I did that with the character too. Too many things have happened to me with the subject of my brother. Many compulsions. I spent hours in my room doing compulsions, and cried a lot. Bit well. What is killing me now is that I had a sexual thought of my sister-in-law having sex and as always everything I think the image of my brother comes in, and that thought of my sister-in-law turned me on. And then I thought and wanted to see and test, will I feel the same if I think about it with my brother? So I put it to the test and I felt arousal, I didn't want to leave it like that, so I thought again the same act with another person to check if I could feel the same arousal, and yes it happened, not so much, but I felt it. That calmed me down. The thing is that I spent a some minutes imagining the sexual act to check and my body turned on. So again THE PROBLEM, real one, lol, is that I masturbated after having that groinal response and arousal that I felt from that instrusive sexual thought from my sister-in-law and then test myself to see if I felt the same with my brother, and I felt groinal and arousal, and that made me feel bad so I rethought it with another person to see if I felt groinal response and arousal and I felt it too. Not as much similar as from my brother, but I felt groinal response and arousal to that person too. Then my body turned on with all this testing/checking idk. I think I went to the bathroom and I had this habit that every time I went to pee I masturbated, I stopped doing it because I didn't want to have images of my brother anymore. But following what I said before that time I wanted to masturbate because I wanted to get rid of that arousal feeling  and I told myself that I hadn't done it for days and I really wanted to get rid of that feeling that was provoked by thinking and checking sexual scenarios with those people because of that instrusive sexual thought I had. And I did it, I masturbated, and of course, the cursed images of my brother appeared. So I did what I did before, think his image deliberately and modify it into another person or a shadow. It's just that images of him always get into everything, I hate it so much. No matter how much I push them away, they always come. And after I did that, I thought about it with other people, while I was masturbating, other family members, and I felt it too. That calmed me down. But then I felt that I didn't do it right and I spent a long time thinking about my brother, and family members to see if I felt the same. I did feel that of being able to climax. I felt so bad after. I spent almost all day ruminating, it exhausting. Please someone tell me this is part of that disorder or confirm if I am already a disgusting degenerate. It's horrible, these sexual thoughts even in my dreams come out, even in my dreams I'm there and these thoughts come and I do compulsions in the dreams. It's horrible and I'm afraid to sleep because I don't want to dream that. I even felt like I was masturbating in real life when I dreamt something like that, but it doesn't matter that much, I think, I've seen it happen to other people and well, I don't know. I don't know. I hope someone can give me an answer about that too. PLEASE ANSWER THIS? TOO Sometimes I would like to die, I really want to live, but not like this. It's not fair, I just wanted to have a nice healthy relationship with my brother. I feel like I shouldn't be loved for what I think and have done. I feel like I don't deserve to be loved. I feel very sad and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't cry. Once I even made myself throw up to distract myself from what I was feeling, it was horrible, it was the only thing I could think of, I couldn't stop crying and once I even forced myself to watch real gore to traumatize myself with it and distract myself from the thoughts. Now I go around reading and watching videos on how to overcome this, some days I do well, others I fall back down the rabbit hole. But these two days I have improved little, sometimes I start to ruminate without realizing it, but I try to do it less often, as a specialist in this advises. But what I'm telling you, it happened 3 days ago and no matter how much I look for someone who has had the same thing happen to them, it doesn't calm me down, I have already found two experiences like mine and that before it calmed me down and now it doesn't! I go back to think about it and analyze it and feel that it feels \"right\". Then the same thing happens again, it doesn't calm me down anymore and I still don't know what happens if it helped me before. I would really appreciate it if you could answer me and thank you. Or if anyone has gone through the same thing, even if it calms me down but I think I will feel bad afterwards and look for more things to calm me down, it seems like the same cycle. Any advice or anything please. I am begging you guys. I also hope you guys are doing better, even a little bit and if not...don't give up. Also when I go to sleep those thoughts flood me, and sometimes I'm tired of pushing them away. So I pay a lot of attention to them and I think about them and that makes me feel bad, I don't want to think about them but they are still there and I don't know what to do. It's like a rubber band, I think about it, I don't want to keep thinking about it, I walk away and I think about them harder and I stay there because it's so hard not to think about them and that makes me feel very very bad. I feel like I want to think that and I like it. I have also felt desire and that I like the thoughts, but I saw that it happens to others and it is a symptom of this apparently. And this only happens when I go to sleep. Any advice for this? I don't know if I have anything to do with it, but I have always felt aberration towards sex. I don't know if it was because my little brother's dad used to touch my parts when I was a little girl, I think I was about 5-6 years old? And that makes me feel guilty because I didn't stop him. But I know it's not my fault, I recently understood that, it still makes me feel really bad. When I was happy, my happiness didn't last long because that memory would come to my mind and make me cry and feel guilty. I am afraid to be happy, because if I am happy I feel that something bad will come and take away my happiness. I haven't been happy for days, I don't feel like doing anything, it's hard for me to take a bath. But I always try to do things that I like, for example taking care of plants, plants give me reasons to get out of bed and water them, and see how they grow. Some things that make me happy. This #######5 disorder has taken away everything that made me happy, now I can't even read books or comics or series because those thoughts are there, or listen to music because they make me think of my brother when I don't want to think of him. It's the worst. And im really jealous of people who do those things without those damn thoughts tormenting them. Plants and writing is the only thing that hasn't taken over. I don't have much left, but oh well. Thanks if you read all this, it means a lot to me. I missed a lot of things during this, but the ones I mention are the ones that are worrying me a lot, alsooo I haven't been diagnosed with this $#%^ disorder, I doubt that I have it, it's kind of clear, but I want to be diagnosed, I want to feel better, I'm trying rn by myself. I do those compulsions of searching if others have experienced same things like me to see if I have ocd haha :c and make sure I'm not a bad, disgusting person.  Id rather die than having those kind of acts with my brother, when I see him I want to cry, i don't feel any kind of attraction towards him, I don't like to hug him or physical touches bc I don't want to feel something but maybe I do ill bc this $#%^ condition can make you feel worse and worse so ill try not to care but yeah. I'm really sad, I wish I could have a nice relationship with him, good siblings relationship, maybe someday haha",
      "I want to clarify that I don't use my brother image to fantasize or smth like that... I've never done it",
      "This is kinda funny because rn what I pósted doesn't worry me lmao. Now another thing is worrying me but we'll, I'll try to disregard",
      "I'm so sorry you're going through all of this. From someone who has suffered with OCD, this sure all sounds like OCD to me. I think deep down you know all of this isn't you. Especially since you go through cycles of ruminating over completely different things. It sounds as though your obsessions have latched on to things you fear: cancer, sexual deviancy -and then sends you down a spiral of doubt & intrusive thoughts regarding these subjects. Once you dig a hole with OCD it takes time to work your way out of it. Re-frame your issues in your mind as an OCD issue. This isn't about your brother, or you, or cancer, or anything sexual at all - this is an OCD thing now. And when it's an OCD thing, you can start working towards mitigating it. And I can tell you that even taking your OCD from 90% to 60% will drastically improve your life, with eventually getting it down to like 5% of what it is now as the goal. With OCD it will always manifest itself in some ways, but quality of life can GREATLY improve if you learn to manage the illness and stop chasing each thing you're ruminating about. There's a lot of great online resources, books, therapy, this site, trusted loved ones to talk to about aspects of it, etc. You can definitely dig yourself out of this hole, though you will need patience and determination to keep at it especially when you're anxieties are spinning out and there's nothing you want to do more than go ruminate on something. Ignoring that feeling can be the hardest thing in the world. But then the next time it's less hard. And less hard. And then a year from now your OCD is 10x more manageable. After another year it's 100x more manageable. Who do you want to be a year from now? For years I ruminated about the same things. At a certain point it helped to make a resolution to myself that I wasn't going to ruminate on any aspect of something anymore, and then when the doubts, fears and anxieties came in, I'd think about who I wanted to be by this time next year to stay true to my resolution. It's so hard in the moment, but the feeling is temporary. And then it gets easier. That's what worked for me, though everyone is different. But I think the main thing is understanding that the true issue here is OCD, not the things your OCD fear is spinning out on worrying if it's true or not. All the best.",
      "Catnaps!! Thank you so so much for your answer. Im going to do that. Wish you the best and tysm for your words. Hope you have a great day!",
      "Happy if that helped you in any way! All the best!"

      "i just want the truth, but the longer i live with this kind of brain i realize the truth is always changing. reality changes sometimes every hour or minute. i don't know if there's one \"real\" truth or \"true\" reality. i just hope it's the good one. i want it to stay good. when the good one is real I'm so happy, or at least I'm content, and feeling that way compared to now is like total ecstasy. right now it feels like it will never be good again. that maybe the bad truth is real now and it will stay bad forever and never let the good be true again. when i look into my mind over and over i see that it doesn't have to be this way, but being alive with this kind of brain makes it feel impossible to manifest good for any time at all. it feels like this brain will always make the bad real to me, no matter how long I keep it good. i just want it to stay good. or even just okay. i could still feel content in a neutral world but this one is a nightmare. im beyond believing in ways out they never last. it gets to me eventually and takes over my world and every bit of happiness inside me is destroyed. i wish it would last",
      "There are a lot of things that don't make sense. In what way does reality change for you, make no sense for you?  Is this related to your thread about gender OCD?  Or something else?",
      "I'm surprised you remembered that, but I remembered you snaga, so I guess there's stranger things. no, I don't experience gender OCD anymore, haven't for years. and that's a really good thing, isn't it? all the stuff it made me worry about never came to pass. but it's different now. no longer about silly things like that. I've become attuned to some facts about the nature of things, or how my nature affects the facts. my thoughts truly have the ability to change things. they actually do. or maybe I can just sense it when they change. but I know it when they have. there's a correlation between the innards of my mind and real events. I'm not about to debate if the chicken or the egg came first, because you don't really think about things like that when they start pecking out your eyes. it's always horrible things. really bad things. very bad truths. i try to get things to switch back, but I'm not always sure how. there's some things that are beyond me. some end up okay, because I figured out how to fix it. controlling my mind seems to be the trick. but sometimes things just break, and I can't figure out how to solve it. i don't want to make the bad things happen, so i have to try really hard to fix it. because sometimes I fail and I can feel when I've failed. and when I feel things they are the truth. the not making sense comes in when it gives me conflicting signals. it's like your eyes not agreeing with your ears. as if you're seeing yourself sitting calmly but every other sense is telling you you're plummeting in a freefall. which am i supposed to trust? it gets so confusing. so I've gone to assuming any sign means I should prepare for the worst. i know what I can do, so I need to be really careful. people's comfort feels so useless when they don't understand that (but I still crave it), they don't understand what I can sense that they can't. the confusion over it all is unbearable. have I fixed it? will I fix it? is there even any hope? i don't know. it's an impossible problem",
      "Can you give an example?  If you're willing to, that is.",
      "yes, i think so, i was a little nervous about saying at first. and I still am, but i feel very safe here, so I'll try to give the best example I am. i don't think or have false feelings about events. everything that is there is in reality. i just know it is. and i think it's because i thought it so I brought it so. like for instance if i think well of a friend that is good, they are good they are safe and they will continue to be. but if I have thoughts of harming them or other bad ones they are in danger, are in the process of being harmed or will be because of me. and switching back and forth so rapidly is so confusing to me. terrifying. when I have all these feelings and thoughts that conflict, neither can be false, so they have to be true but then that doesn't make sense how can they both be? how is it possible? are they safe or is it dangerous? is it bad or good? can't be both. and i don't know how to stay out the the bad. I can't tell if it's taking over and that will be the truth or if it will never ever happen. but i have to control my brain, I can't just not try and then I cause it, even if i can't stop it. and that's getting so common lately the failures just pile up. the guilt is getting me. it's getting me hard. i need to make things right in my mind but I'm getting worse at it",
      "Okay I think I understand.  You are saying you're convinced your thoughts are affecting reality about you. Tell me about your earlier posts in this forum- the OCD.  Did you ever see anyone for that?  Is there a formal diagnosis of OCD?  Also do you mind if I ask how old you are?"

      "I’ll get to the point. About 11-12 years ago when I was 23-24 or so,  I used to visit a website that had lots of swimsuit models from Japan, korea, and Europe.. Nothing pornographic, but definitely titillating. There was one gal who I found particularly cute, so I had saved a lot of her photos, for what you can imagine. I was vaguely aware that models in other countries can start earlier than in the US, but I trusted the sites staff to moderate carefully. Anyway, fast forward a few years and POCD hits me like a truck. I start worrying about anything and everything I ever saw. I worry about that girl so I do some digging and realize Some of the photos hosted on the site are from when she was 17, Including some (not many but a few) of the ones I had saved. I’m full on panicking at this point. I fee gross that ever had photos of this girl at that age, intentionally or not. I probably had the folder for like a year or so. I feel like a criminal. I’m mad because it didn’t take that much digging too find out, but I was too careless and lazy and stupid to do so back then. I am not very good at paying attention to finer details sometimes due to having ADHD. I never bothered to do the small bit of legwork, and I feel ashamed, and guilty, and stupid. I’m also mad that I just assumed a website in the English speaking world would not be allowed to do that. I guess I kinda just believed the system worked, as it were. Now I feel like I don’t deserve the loving wife and children I have. I feel like I don’t deserve to pursue my personal goals and dreams. I feel like a gross monster. I don’t know what to do, and I’m just looking for support. I screwed up and feel awful about it.",
      "Let me see if I got this right - you were looking at a female in a swimsuit who, you subsequently learned years later, was 17 years old at the time. And you were 23-24 at the time? Is this correct?",
      "That’s pretty much the gist of it. I feel really worried because I had saved some pictures too, and that worries me that I could have had illegal material for a length of time without even realizing it. I just feel super guilty about the whole thing. I feel guilty for not noticing the date stamps for pics, the model’s info, etc. I just figured it was sorted by the site. Part of my guilt comes from feeling stupid too, for sure, but mostly because I see this as a transgression of my idea of myself.",

And you were 23-24 at the time? Is this correct? Essentially that’s the basics. It’s more a Moral Scrupulosity concern than POCD I think. Part of the guilt comes from feeling like I just wasn’t paying attention. Some of the model’s info was available and some people often cited the sources of the pics, name and date of publication, but I just didn’t notices until years later when I went back to check. Not noticing things is a lifelong issue for me.",
      "Pretty sure when I was 23 or 24, I would have checked out a 17 year old without thinking too much about it.  Dating one, okay yeah proceed with caution, sure.  But looking at a photo of a 17 year old in a swimsuit?  At 23, you were only four years out from being a teenager yourself.",
      "Nothing you wrote in the initial post or subsequent responses indicates a hint of being a P, the definition of which is very different than what you discussed above. As Snaga pointed out, you were nearly the age of the person in the picture. The numeric age for a consenting adult is a legal tool. It is not meant to indicate that someone who has turned 18 is now leaps and bounds more sexually mature than they were the day before their birthday. When I was 23 or 24 I wasn't leaps and bounds more sexually aware than when I was 17. Sexual desire at either age was basically in the same arena. It's good to have that age of 18 as a borderline because of people with bad intentions. But it should not be concerning to someone who has desires as you explained. But all of this is academic to someone who suffers OCD. Sadly, rational explanations don't cut it. I haven't looked at your other posts but I hope you might consider getting help if this continues. OCD is awful. I have suffered it all my life, I know.",

      "Sorry, I did not mean to quote myself there. That would also be silly. My main fear I guess is I don’t know how long I had the photos saved, and was it a crime or something like that. The initiating incident happened 2011-2012 or so, but for all I know I may have had the files until at most 2014, which would make me closer to 30, and somehow that freaks me out.",

And I think you are right. I just remember hearing somewhere that something could be considered CP if it has a minor in a suitably  suggestive pose or something like that. These were still tasteful for sure, but they were probably more titillating than your average catalogue. Closer to VS swimwear likely. Again I didn’t know, but you know how OCD is. I still feel bad."

      "I have been diagnosed with OCD. My current topic is the fear of being a p - well since lately I don't think I'm a p but I'm obsessing over things I did or thought. For context: I'm writing a story. In the story the protagonist got sexually abused as a child. I was once walking down the street thinking about this story and wanted to imagine the child getting abused (again, for the story not for pleasure or whatever though I'm know ruminating about that). But right as I had the image I immediately shook it off, was disgusted and told myself that was going too far and that I shall not think that. I was neither aroused nor liked the image. I simply pushed it away and forgot it but today I remembered it. Though I don't think it proves that I'm a p since I was not aroused and didn't like the thought I feel like I'm a horrible monster who should die. To be clear again: this was not an intrusive thought, but a thought I wanted to have for my story. I wad disgusted and disturbed by it. I don't know if I'm overreacting or it. One part of me feels like I do since I didn't even like the thought but the other thinks I'm a horrible monster who wanted it out of lust. Please, help me!",
      "I feel like this is a really common post on here. To have a fear of this and then take the smallest event or thought and spin out wondering if you're some kind of monster. It's obvious to me you're not what you fear. Everyone in the world has had a disturbing thought pop into their head at some point. It's just people with OCD who latch onto that thought and try to see if there's any truth about themselves in it out of fear - when in reality you know deep down there is no truth in it. The anxious fear will pass if you don't engage with it. But if you engage with it, it will only make your anxiety stronger and solidifying OCD patterns of thinking in your brain. All the best, and hope you have let this go.",
      "Sometimes, thoughts are just thoughts. I have had taboo thoughts- sometimes me as the taboo object, occasionally otherwise.  And I mean multiple taboos, not one specific thing.  Things that would not be pleasant if experienced.  None of which have anything to do with the real world, or my morality, or desires, or anything else, because they're just thoughts.  And thoughts that are just thoughts, and aren't a reflection of something you'd really do, or want to do, or be, are only thoughts.  And thoughts that aren't acted on, don't have to mean a thing. I'm not much of a writer, but I can be a pretty good maladaptive daydreamer And if a story arc includes something pretty rough, well, it does.  It's my story, crafted in my head.  And that's all that it is. Make believe.  Look, a person can watch a drama about sexual abuse, or a horror show, or a murder show, and not be or want to be any of those things, yeah?  I listen to horror punk sometimes- and if I'm singing along about 52 ways to murder anyone, doesn't mean I want to do it .  Okay then.  Why does it have to be different if it's in your head?  If it's part of something imaginative and not something that's a paraphilia, or some terrible urge, then surely, it is just a thought.  And you are writing a story.  How can you write a story, without imagining the things you're writing?  It's like trying not to think of something- you can't. Like Catnaps said, OCD makes our thoughts seem so overwhelmingly important to us.  We often have a problem separating thoughts from I guess you'd say the ego (in the Freudian sense of the word).  For us, if we think it, then it must be an integral part of us.  'OMG, I thought this!  I must want to do it!'  Well, no.  I argue No.  Because what Catnaps said.  Normies get dark or weird thoughts just as much as you or I.  And they shrug it off as 'just a thought'.  What comes natural for someone without OCD, is a skill we must cultivate or we'll drive ourselves to distraction over thoughts. Having said all that, as far as my own thoughts go, I know my comfort zone, and my limits, and what I'm willing to think or not think, in relation to the above internal story-making.  Some subjects well I just don't go there- call it OCD, call it my morality, call it the Ew Factor.  But the point I'm trying to make is that even if something gives me personally the creeps, just thinking it does not mean a person wants to do or be that.  The mere presence of a thought's not enough, if it's not connected to desire or drive or urge."

      "Hey, it's me again. Another case of harm ocd, yet each time I believe that this time it's real. So, I was in my car enjoying the lunch time sun at the park. A mother walked by with her baby in the pram. Her baby saw me and said \" bye bye\" and I waved. I instantly got a thought about how I could harm the baby but I knew that it was just a thought but distressing nonetheless.  It's been. 4 days since then and now I'm thinking I have blacked out and somehow killed the baby. I've tried to.work on cbt strategies and evidence . I keep saying it's not in my nature and I'm a caring person and if I did such a thing, I would be in trouble. Can anyone please help me? Wouldn't I be in jail by now? Thank you",
      "You already know deep down that it's OCD, so I won't address that part of it. But I do think you need a new strategy for dealing with OCD. In my experience, telling yourself that you're a caring person etc in response to this type of fear is exactly the wrong thing to be doing. You should NEVER reassure yourself when it comes to OCD. Reassuring yourself after an OCD doubt only reinforces the OCD loop and only allows you to feel better for a brief time anyway. The only way out is to not engage with the thought at all. Recognize it as an OCD thought, and then don't reassure yourself. Sit in the anxiety but go on with your day. It will probably be the hardest thing you've ever done, but it will start to break you out of OCD cycles and your anxiety will slowly start to become less and less, and it will get easier and easier. But you have to stick with this strategy. Every time you break it and go reassuring yourself, you undermine all the progress you've made. There are probably other much easier things you can do to mitigate OCD, but this is the only one in my experience that will truly get you back to living your life. If you reassure yourself on this in any way, you are just setting yourself up for another OCD doubt to mess you up in the future. You have to break that old pattern and break through the anxiety. I wish you all the best and to be strong. I know how utterly brutal it is to sit through anxiety. It's akin to overcoming a bad addiction or something. But you CAN do this. You truly can.",
      "Don't you think that the news, and everyone, would be talking about that baby-killer?  And searching, and using cam footage, if any? When I hit an invisible (re: imaginary) pedestrian- and I've hit plenty of invisible pedestrians- I try to make an effort to not check, not go back, because if there was a real pedestrian there, and I hit them, I'd know it.  You hit something the size of a person, you know it.  I have (personally) known people who hit other people and didn't realise they'd hit a person.  But they knew they'd hit something .  And then figured it out, because it was all over the freakin' news.  Which it would be, if you'd done something to that child.  This whole blackout thing is an OCD lame attempt at hanging on to this harm fear in the face of all logic, as far as I'm concerned.  OCD has tried telling me I'll black out and harm someone.  I'll hit a real pedestrian and somehow not know it (even though I damn well would).  And the only way I've gotten over any of that, is to just say No.  No I will not 'black out', I haven't blacked out, and I'll worry about harming someone after I've actually done it and know I've done it, not before.  I'll have plenty of chances to panic then, until then, I defer anxiety until I've done, or am accused of doing, something real to a real person.  I have said here time and again esp in regard to harm OCD themes that of course you care if you hurt someone.  But you have to have the attitude of not caring.  Worry about it when you've done it, not before.  That one thing has done a lot to quieten down intrusive harm thoughts.  My thoughts aren't going to make me do anything I don't want to do."

      "I am M17 and I think I have been suffering from POCD since the beginning of July (not diagnosed, the symptoms described my condition very well). There was a trigger for this that I was aware of. At first it was like many people have, compulsions, unwanted thoughts and anxiety. Before it all started, everything was normal and I was interested in women of the same age or older and had no pedophilic fantasies or anything like that. But now it feels so real, like I'm just in denial. This thought, however, scares me extremely. Even writing all this I am afraid that I am in denial. I avoid children for the most part because  whenever I see them a shudder goes through my body and I am afraid. Even hearing them or childhood memories trigger fear and sometimes a slight tightening in my body. If I don't avoid them I'm afraid that I'm a pedo and I want to get close to them. I also have intrusive thoughts but they scare me and i dont want them. But sometimes they arouse me and i have the urge to masturbate, I know the symptom of groinal response. But to me it feels so real. I also sometimes have the feeling that something is stirring there without me really fixating on it when these thoughts come. Can it still be a groinal response? I often have an extreme fear of masturbating because these intrusive thoughts come especially often.    I'm afraid that I'll give in and want to masturbate to them and that I'll be a pedo or that I'll really enjoy it because it feels like that sometimes. Most of the time these thoughts are about a child that I know. But I don't want to have these thoughts and sometimes I get very sick out of fear and I cry. Also I often can't sleep because of these thoughts. Sometimes I ask myself when I have these intrusive thoughts that I would actually like to masturbate to it. I never do it but I think it would make me \"want\" to. I don't know how long I can go without doing it. The thought that I could do it and be so close to it scares me. It's like I'm a pedo with OCD. Is that still POCD? I never had these thoughts and desire before all this started. It's like I discovered that I enjoy it and that I am a pedo. But sometimes I catch myself thinking: \"even if you are one, it's not a big deal\" or \"just accept it, it's not a big deal\". Then I quickly realise what I'm actually thinking and worry about why I thought that. Can this still be POCD? When I'm well or have a brief moment of clarity, I often think to myself that I'm not and I know that. But then the fears about the intrusive thoughts come back and the questions about whether I like them or not. I just want to live like I did before, I had ideas of how I would have a family with a wife of the same age and possibly children. But these ideas have been totally destroyed by this fear. The fear soon eats me up and I sometimes wish I wasn't there. Is this still POCD? If so, can I do something about it? Sorry for language mistakes, my mother tongue is not English.",
      "I'm not going to offer reassurances, because that is like a drug (as I have been experiencing over the past couple of weeks). No matter how many people tell you that you are not a pedophile, you still will have that doubt in your mind. The truth is, that you will never be 100% sure, because there is no \"proof\". We are talking about something that only exists in your mind, how do you prove if it exists or not? The only thing you can say is \"Maybe I am a pedophile, maybe I am not.\" ^^This sucks. You will feel anxious, and icky, and have compulsions to reassure yourself, to check if are attracted, to review who you have been attracted to. Don't do them. If you find yourself doing them, say to yourself \"I might be a pedofile.\" Think of OCD like quicksand. The more you struggle, the deeper you will sink. If you lay back and float, you will eventually be able to get out of the hole. The thoughts will always be there, but their importance will fade, and you will eventually be able to focus on other things. Not going to lie, this is going to be hard. People with other types of OCD will sometimes wash their hands until they bleed. We are doing the same thing, only internally. All we can do is have faith that it will get better. Live with the uncertainty.",
      "For more information you can check out my previous post. I am M 17 Meanwhile, I sometimes feel no fear and disgust at all at the intrusive thoughts. This worries me. I sometimes don't feel anything anymore, such a numbness. I am not as attracted to my peers or older women as I used to be. I feel like i turned into a pedo. Is thid still POCD? I See a lot of people saying that if you are a p then you know it. It feels like I know it and just have fear. I read also that some P's also have fear and so on. It feels like I am one. I have fear and panik right now. Please help me. It is so bad right now. Sometimes I know also i am not a pedo. It feels like i've got a pedo through POCD. When I have anxiety, which is still relatively often, I am very afraid of masturbating to these intrusive thoughts. I'm also scared that I might fall in love with a child and scared like a pedo that I'll be alone forever. It feels so real sometimes that I am convinced I am one.  Is this also POCD? When I masturbate I sometimes don't know what I masturbated to afterwards and I'm afraid it might have been children. My brain sometimes convinces me that I did it, even though I know I didn't do it. I just want to be normal again. What can I do about this? Thank you"

      "I have been reading fanfiction since I was in middle school. When I was a teenager I started reading explicit fanfiction. A lot of the fanfiction I was reading involved teenagers. However, I read a few explicit fanfictions that involved a lot younger characters (I found one that I remember reading where the character is 8 ). Some of the fanfiction involved non-consensual activities with characters who were probably around 13. I don't think I was really thinking about the ages at the time I read them, but now I'm terrified that there is something wrong with me. I was old enough to know what I was doing was wrong (17). I see a lot of people obsessing over reading fanfiction about teenagers, but I feel like what I did was a lot worse. What sucks is that I know that I have never actually had any thoughts and urges to hurt children, and that I was probably just a stupid teenager that wasn't thinking critically about the content I was consuming. However, I still feel like a monster and a creep, and like I am the only person who has done something this bad.",
      "I think you're making a lot more out of this than you need to be doing.  You were still a minor, yourself, for starters.  And stuff like that is sort of a grey-area, it's not as if you were consuming things that actually exploited real-life people.  Kids do weird things because teenagers are generally pretty horny little creatures- I know I for sure was.  With age comes maturity and the brain gets developed enough you start thinking 'hmm is this creepy'?  In the end it's just fanfic, if explicit, and you're not the one who wrote it, and you find it outside of your comfort level now.  My rule of thumb for grey-area stuff like that is that if it makes me uncomfortable, I decide to not look/read it.  As I age, that bar gets lowered and more stuff feels creepy, because I don't want to be a creepy old man.  You're not an old man.  You were a teenager, doing teenagery things that didn't harm anyone.",
      "I don't know if this might help someone in the future, but here have been some of the intrusive thoughts I have had and practice ERP ( TRIGGER WARNING ); If I read explicit fanfiction about children, what if I'm attracted to children? (So what? That doesn't mean I would have to act on it. Maybe I am, maybe I'm not) If I read explicit fanfiction about children, what if I could have looked at images of real children? (Maybe it could have happened, maybe not) I didn't have any younger of siblings, but if I did, what if I experimented with them? (Maybe that would've happened, maybe not) If I have kids someday, what if I do something inappropriate to them? (Maybe that will happen, maybe it won't) If people knew, would they think I'm a sex offender? (Maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't) Still haven't been able to feel normal again, and I have days where I feel too sick to leave the house. But it's a marathon, not a sprint. One compulsion I have not been able to break has been obsessively googling. Definitely not helpful. (Speaking of which, if you are reading this, STOP DOING THAT ) Anyone who is in the same boat, hang in there, you deserve to live again.",
      "I hope this is okay, but I think I'm going to treat this thread as sort of a journal of my progress. Hopefully if someone else has the same problem, this might help them. My anxiety has lessened, and so have my compulsions somewhat. But I don't think it's because of ERP (I have been a very bad client and haven't been doing my homework). I just feel tired. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but I haven't been able to concentrate on anything. I left the milk out for hours, left laundry in the apartment laundry room for days, and literally left the vacuum running with out realizing, all because I was so focused on what was happening mentally. Other people have noticed too. I haven't told anyone what I'm experiencing because I'm scared, but when I'm at work or with my boyfriend, people will ask me what I'm thinking about. My guess is that I just have a blank stare on my face. The obsessive googling needs to stop. So I'm making a pack with myself to stay off Google (and this forum) all day tomorrow. One day, no googling. I might have to throw my phone into the river."

      "Hello. I am perfectly aware that what I'm doing right now is probably just seeking reassurance; however, I'm unable to afford a good therapist (and the ones I have been able to afford are very subpar), so this is the only option I have left. I also sincerely and profusely apologize if this post becomes too convoluted or incomprehensible. For a bit of backstory, I'm a porn addict. I suppose that I'm using porn to cope with underlying (and undiagnosed) mental issues, since I don't have any friends IRL and the circumstances of my upbringing... weren't exactly the best, to put it mildly. I have frequently masturbated to fanart/softcore porn of underage fictional characters and continue to do so. I'm not even sure why I'm attracted to them - maybe it's their designs, maybe it's their personalities, or maybe it's precisely the fact that they are fictional, idk. Right now, I don't know anything about myself. I have also fantasized about said fictional characters participating in sexual situations and masturbated to a number of fan fics depicting the characters in sexual situations. Recently, I started seeing a lot of posts on social media claiming that everyone who does the things I do are sick pedophile freaks, and that made me very anxious about myself. It's like these thoughts constantly gnawing at me - \"What if you're a pedophile and you're just denying it or trying to resist your urges? A lot of pedophiles don't want to be pedophiles, feel guilty about their urges and use the stuff you are watching as an outlet for them, so that means that you're a pedophile.\" These thoughts are accompanied by vivid mental images of naked IRL children and graphic sex with them, which are... quite uncomfortable. Sometimes these mental images feature the fictional characters I masturbated to. I think It's important to note that I have only began thinking all that stuff after I saw the numerous social media posts; I didn't think much of my preferences in porn before because I was sure they don't reflect myself. That confidence... kind of dissipated after I saw the posts, I guess. I think it's also important to note a specific incident that happened to me several weeks ago. I had to wait for a bus at a bus stop, so I sat down near a mother and her little kids. When I looked at them, I felt my penis slightly jerk upward. That also was quite the uncomfortable experience. People call it a \"groinal response\" and note that this is quite common for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, but idk. I spent the last several days obsessively reading about pedophilia in an effort to convince myself that I'm not a pedophile. I've actually encountered people with the exact same problems. Some people said that it's okay because it's all fiction anyways and some people claimed that the asker is a pedophile and should be put to death. Naturally, this has only exacerbated my concerns. I don't remember ever feeling sexual attraction to IRL children before, and that also fuels my anxiety - what if I did experience sexual attraction to them in the past, and I just don't remember it? What if I will start experiencing sexual attraction to them at some point in the future? What if the thing I'm going through now is just me trying to deny my pedophilia? Another thing worthy of note is the fact that I have already went to a private psych doc for intrusive thoughts about killing a family relative of mine and an obsessive fear of having schizophrenia. As such, I suspect that this may just be my OCD-addled mind picking something horrifying to torture me with, but I'm unsure. Right now, I'm feeling... weirdly accepting of my situation. Even of the vivid mental images. It's like \"Yeah, I'm a pedo. So what?\" Again, I'm not sure whether it's my mind slowly learning to work around the intrusive thoughts to calm me down or me accepting that I'm an actual pedophile and that also makes me anxious. One last thing worthy of note is that I've just turned 18 this July. This gives me reason to assume that whatever the hell I'm going through right now is just me still being overly hormonal. Once again, I'm not sure about anything right now. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you to anyone who takes their time to read this.",
      "Hey! I have had a similar experience when I was about your age. First up, fanfic and fanart mean nothing about your real world preferences. However, I would recommend staying away from them (or any of the sexually explicit stuff), especially if you have OCD. I have also been obsessively googling....we both need to stop doing that. It's not going to give you a concrete answer, because what you did is not black and white. Some people will say its fine, some people will say it's a crime. People are judgmental, especially when it comes to anything related to pedophilia. I personally wish I never consumed that kind of content, but now I know better, and maybe I can use my experiences to help others. It's like \"Yeah, I'm a pedo. So what?\" ^^This is good! I'm proud of you, this is EXACTLY what you need to be doing with those thoughts. I wish I had more advice, but I'm in the same boat and haven't been able to get past it yet. People have done much worse and have found a way to live a meaningful life. Hoping the best for you, you are not alone.",
      "This is very much OCD. All the 'what if' doubts and fears, the obsessive googling and ruminating... all of these are the most OCD thing ever. I'm confident that if the fears/memories of all this were erased from your mind that you would go on living and never harm a child a day in your life. I get the concern and the questioning about yourself, but intrusive thoughts are not you. They never will be you. If anything they are just a manifestation of what you're most scared of - so in essence, you are the opposite of what you fear. It's obvious you don't want to harm a child. It seems to me like you just fell into a cartoon fetish while you had raging hormones, and then your OCD doubts got hold of it and now are running with fears about yourself. I think you have to be careful when it comes to OCD, because you can really dig yourself a hole with it. If you're always looking for any evidence that you're attracted to kids then at some point you're going to find something that your OCD will dig at until you've convinced yourself that you're a monster. It's really hard to do, but you have to let it go. I think you should also change what porn you watch though. With porn you can go down paths that take you to further and further extremes and to unhealthy places. At the risk of sounding preachy, you're going to have to learn to take better care of yourself. And that means making the right choices on a daily basis; choosing not to ruminate, choosing healthy porn, choosing to be kind to yourself, etc."

      "Hi again, It's me - I've written on here a couple of times, but I'm really, really not doing well. I'm not sure if a lot of you remember me, but I am a 24-year-old woman who has been suffering from HOCD since 21. I am at my wit's end here. I'm crying while typing this because I can't believe the pain I've been through. I also feel like this forum has been dead recently, so if anyone sees this, please help me. My Hocd has gotten so bad. While I'm working, I listen to podcasts about ocd all day, message therapists, and browse forums. I work from home, so it's greatly affected my work ethic. I feel like I'm so different from other HOCD sufferers they all always say, \"I never thought about the same sex until I had this thought\" Mine is so different - I've experimented once in puberty, I've watched lesbian porn, and I've kissed friends drunk. What really bothers me is I've had straight friends do all the same things as them, and they never thought anything of it. Why does my past have to affect me so much!!! Any gay thought before this I ever had didn't matter to me. I knew I liked men and was sexually attracted to them. I remember one time me and my friends all got together, and someone initiated the conversation of sexuality. Some of my friends said they only watched lesbian porn, and a lot of them revealed they didn't consider themselves 100% straight. Do you think women have a higher tendency to be bicurious? I use to not worry about this stuff at all, and it didn't matter to me that I wasn't 100% straight because I knew I had a strong preference towards men. Now everything past thing I have ever done has come to attack me. Even one of my straightest female friends admitted once, she and her friend in middle school would practice kissing with each other. (THIS IS WAY WORSE THAN MY EXPERIMENT) I wouldn't care if I was bisexual, but my OCD has caused the worst rigid thinking. It's either I'm straight, or I am a full-on lesbian. I'm also in love with my boyfriend, and not that platonic I love you love. Like the love of being in his arms and staring into his eyes. I felt this love for my first boyfriend as well in our honeymoon phase, but it wore off as the relationship went on. Me and my boyfriend have such an amazing sex life too. Like I look into his eyes and feel so in love and TMI, but he gets me super wet. I honestly do not think I could go through with having sex with a woman. I've thought very long and hard about it, and ultimately, it doesn't give me any feelings of lust or desire. I also never have met a woman in real life and thought, \"wow, I need to get her in bed,\" but I've met men whom I've practically wanted to tear their clothes off then and there. (sadly, I rarely get these feelings anymore) I guess my question is, how can I forgive myself for my curious past, and does it make me bisexual? I keep looking through all my old messages with friends & diaries, and it was always boys, boys, boys. I was in public, and it was always boys, boys, boys. I don't think it would be wrong to be bisexual at all, but taking away my attraction for men and having to be stuck having sex with a woman and marrying one makes me feel so sad. Can I also add before hocd kicked down my door I slept with over 12 men? Do you think being a lesbian is even possible for me or am I just beating myself up.",
      "Try pretending you're someone else, and read your post. Do you think that person is a lesbian?  Do they sound even remotely like one, other than some insignificant messing around and watching porn?  Which is fantasy.  Which people are allowed to have, you know.  Fantasy, that is.  And fantasy isn't always an indication of what you'd be willing or want to do in real life.  I fantasize about things that I definitely would never want to do or have happen to me. hocdgirl1313 wrote: It's either I'm straight, or I am a full-on lesbian. I'm Bisexual, and I've never had HOCD but yes OCD is like that about sexuality.  Every so often I go though the same histrionics with myself.  Rarely, now- because I made the decision what I was, based on my behaviour and desires.  But every so often I have to remember that I'm definitely not straight, but I'm not Gay, gay gay gay gay and more gay, either, because I'm most definitely not that, either.  I may be screwed up, but I can look at myself and know what I'm not, and I'm not all one thing, or the other.  But OCD tries to do that to a person.  Even if I've never had 'HOCD'- never just was terrified of being gay.  Despondent over the idea, but not scared oh no my life is over kind of thing.  Because I know what gets my motor running and what doesn't.  And it seems pretty clear what gets your motor running, so the idea causes you rather more distress, don't you think? I really think most people are almost but not completely straight or gay.  And mostly straight- that's the normal state, that's the majority of humans.  And well, I think most people shrug off that little bit of them that might think about getting a little freaky, or it comes out only when intoxicated (as you have confessed).  I sometimes watch videos by an anesthesiologist and he mentioned it's not only very common for someone hopped up on surgery drugs to express undying infatuation with their surgeon/nurses/anesthesiologist in the operating room, but not uncommon either for it to be aimed at someone of the same sex- because inhibitions go bye-bye when you're gassed up.  And that's normal behaviour in those circumstances- embarrassing, but normal (assuming a person even remembers it afterwards). But, OCD.  So maybe you might be capable (but not longing) of messing around with a girl.  Mountains out of molehills is what we do best.  Your brain blows it way out of proportion and makes it into a monster that it just really isn't, looking at it from the outside. To me, folks have to make the decision to not care if their OCD-fueled fear comes true.  I have harm OCD.  I have to not care if I hurt/kill someone.  That is to say, I have to cop that attitude.  I'll worry about it, when it happens.  Not before.  What hasn't happened, doesn't exist .  When I do something heinous, then I'll freak out.  Then I'll worry.  Not before.  No compulsions, no doing things to make myself 'safe' from acting on an intrusive thought, nothing.  Just forced trust in myself that my intrusive thoughts are just thoughts, and thoughts can't make me do or be something I don't wish to.  Thoughts about being lesbian, do not make you one, and they can't make you one, and if you were the lesbian your brain is screaming at you, you definitely wouldn't get so wet for your b/f, now would you? Well, no. I think the thing to do is try to look back on those past experiences, and think (as if you were not you, but someone else looking into your mind) on things like lesbian porn and stuff, and make a deliberate decision what you is.  'Well I might do this or that with a girl but I really like guys'- as an example.  And make that your story, and stick to it when OCD screams at you 'Lesbian Lesbian Lesbian!'  Well, no- because b/f and wet.  And if that decision you make is that maybe you're a little flexible, then you might also find yourself reminding yourself 'well, not quite straight, either'.  And you'll feel a lot better about yourself, because you nailed yourself down to something that when OCD tries to give you fits, you can point to and say 'nope, I'm THIS, don't try to BS me'.  At least, that's how I do myself.  Again, never had what I'd call HOCD but that doesn't mean OCD won't make me angsty about sexuality if I let it do so- been that way plenty of times and I finally just had to mentally write it down on paper what I am, and doesn't matter if I like it or not that's how it is, that's what the evidence points to, and OCD can go to Hell when it screams at me I'm gay- or when it tells me I'm straight but have put myself through histrionics for nothing.  I tell you- being for real somewhere in the middle is not fun when you have OCD, because as you've noticed, your brain wants to make everything binary.  Got to be 1000% this or that, and while most folks seem to be 99-44/100% straight, that .0066 not-straight is going to give someone with OCD who has the misfortune to just once think 'omg maybe I'm not straight' absolute fits.  You so don't seem much like a lesbian to me but that little bit of 'I kissed a girl and I liked it' in you is going to get so blown out of proportion thanks to OCD.  Which is the cue for you to beat OCD over the head with your boyfriend and your physical response to the thought of him. Don't you think? hocdgirl1313 wrote: Do you think women have a higher tendency to be bicurious? I think that women are slightly more flexible.  I've read about some research that seems to bear that out, but even then it seems that to actually switch teams required real and sincere motivation to make the switch from just being a little bicurious, to full on Lesbian.  You just don't wake up one day and be like 'oh I'm a Lesbian now'- you'd have to have a compelling reason to do so.  Guys aren't wired that way, according to the same research I've heard about- we're much more nailed down.  I'm about 50/50 and like it or not, I'm pretty much stuck that way, yay me.  But again, even with girls, to turn Lesbian seems to require motivation and the desire to switch.  You think you got that?  I have my doubts, you like dudes too much.  I also think in the context of 99-44/100% straight women, being a tiny bit Bi doesn't carry the social stigma it would if you were a guy.  I mean, not to be unnecessarily crude, but I can tell you as a guy, I don't mind seeing two cute girls kiss each other.  I mean, back in the day (I'm pretty old) if I'd caught a girlfriend/wife messing around with another girl, it's be a tossup between 'you cheated on me, dammit!' and, ' you didn't let me watch , Goddammit! '.  That's a guy thing for sure- willing to bet a lot (most?) of us are wired that way.  Now how many women think it's so hawt when two dudes that have had a few too many Bud Lights get kissy with each other?  I've known women (online) who say they think it's sexy, but damn if I've ever met a girl like that in real life.  Um, betting that's not a near-universal, like the other way around is.  So actually you have the freedom to get just a little bit of freak on, and dudes don't.  No, we most definitely don't get to play that game without getting instantly labeled. As for self-forgiveness, is it necessary?  What have you done that's so heinous?  How's a young person supposed to figure out what they are and what they ain't without the freedom to experiment?"

      "Ever since I was young teenager I always enjoyed watching anime. I made friends from it and it has given me some good memories and motivation throughout my life. As a young teenager masturbation was apart of my life and I would almost always use porn as fap material like most others do. Around the age of 19 - 20 is when things got really bad. I began deep diving into hentai since normal porn wasn't as exciting anymore. This ended up being the worst decision of my life. Throughout my masturbation \"career\" I was always very thorough with what I was watching or viewing and didn't want to view something that was morally wrong. This was the same mindset I had when I started to use hentai as fap material. During the early stages of this \"phase\" I didn't think too much of it. There was always the occasional post-nut depression that would arise but eventually that would fade. Until recently... Of course when it comes to searching for fap material there is always the chance of stumbling upon something truly grotesque. In anime/hentai there are things called lolis and shotas. In simpler terms very young looking people. Throughout my hentai phase with was always a danger I would look out for. I would always check tags of the material, before viewing it, to make sure it didn't contain anything of the sort. But, that doesn't mean I didn't encounter it. Usually, once I get bored of something I'm watching or viewing mid-fap I would close it and searching for different material. While searching I would always encounter thumbnails of these lolis and shotas mid-fap and sometimes certain hentai I was viewing wouldn't even put those tags into their description and I would get flashbang by it mid-fap while looking through material. At first I didn't think anything of it and whenever I would encounter this I would exit what I was viewing and outright avoid any grotesque thumbnails I would see. At the age of 21, I had a realization. What if I am a pedophile? I've been encountering this type of stuff for a couple years now and still continued what I was doing. Even though I would avoid this type of content and would remove it whenever I encountered it mid-fap it still haunts me. I know that when masturbation occurs high levels of dopamine are released throughout the body and that porn in itself is an addiction but those these thoughts have been haunting me. \"I was fapping when that content was on my screen\", \"Am I into this?\", \"Does this make me a pedo?\", \"Am I a monster?\", \"Did I ###$ my whole life up?\", \"Should I just die?\" Since these thought entered my mind I completely and outright stopped viewing hentai and anime as a whole. I have been in constant disarray in my life and scared to death that I am a monster in denial. Now I just want to make something clear. I DO NOT SUPPORT CP OR PEDOPHILIA IN ANY WAY! Never had and never will. In fact, I'm not even really of fan of kids to begin with. I find them annoying and gross. But ever since this problem arose this conviction grew stronger and would remind me of my \"hentai phase\". There is no way in hell I would ever go near a child with intentions such as that. But even with those thoughts in my head, the denial and the dark thoughts I had before are also in my head. One day I'll be fine and think nothing of that time in my life and the next I would be in a deep depression ready for life to end. I've looked on numerous websites of other people who are in similar situations and all there posts are filled with comments of how they could possibly dealing with OCD and that the situation they are in is being completely blown out of proportions. But even after reading those stories I just can't let this go. I don't know if these are intrusive thoughts, ruminations, pOCD, bipolar disorder, ANYTHING. I am scared to death and don't know what to do anymore. If someone could please give me some insight it would be much appreciated.",
      "Hey! Don't know if you will see this, but I hope you are doing okay! OCD sucks, but you are not alone. I hope the best for you friend!",
      "I can promise you this is OCD. You are not a pedophile. In fact, you might be the furthest thing from it based on what you've said. OCD is a very insidious thing. It preys on your worst fears and finds any grain of doubt, no matter how outrageous, and nags at you with it until you can't tell what's real anymore, except in moments of clarity. Please trust yourself, and if you can't do that, then trust me: this is OCD and nothing else. There is TRULY nothing to worry about here. If anything, it sounds like you've shown more ethical care in selecting porn than 90% of people out there. But I think this reassurance should come with a warning - that you will likely feel relieved after reading it, but in time the doubts will creep in. It's those moments of OCD doubt that you have to push through, and have to tell yourself beforehand that you're not going to reassure yourself through them, or react to them. That's how OCD loses it's power, by not reacting to it or reassuring yourself about your anxieties. Ignoring a whirlpool of anxiety inside yourself is very difficult, but it's how I've had success in greatly diminishing my OCD personally. It will also set you up for success the next time your brain has an anxiety induced thought of 'what if __ is true about me because of __'. In the midst of anxiety it's near impossible to dismiss your fears, no matter how absurdly untrue. It's only when you're out of the feeling that you can think clearly about anything. All the best and sorry this has happened to you."

      "Hey everyone I’m a 20 year old female with ADHD. This has been bothering me for a while now so I thought I’d share my story and hopefully get some advice. When I was 17 I discovered porn. It started by browsing nsfw subreddits and watching short videos. Fast forward to around 2 years later I discovered anime and hentai. I was about 19 at the time so not took long ago. Before I knew it I was masturbating to hentai sometimes before bed. I don’t think I was too addicted as I didn’t do it too regularly and it didn’t consume my life, but I did it somewhat regularly whenever I got the urge. I always steered clear of loli as I knew that was bad, but one time I was browsing for a video to watch and ended up finding a shota hentai… It didn’t hit me at the time so I just watched and masturbated as I usually do. I didn’t even think of the fact that the character in question was a minor. It wasn’t until months later when I realized what I had done and I started becoming consumed with guilt. I felt absolutely sick to my stomach. I don’t know why I did what I did and to this day it is my biggest regret. I began worrying if I am a pedophile. I haven’t watched any hentai since last year but the guilt has been eating me up inside. I browsed forums to find out more about my situation. Surprisingly, I saw lots of other people also dealing with this. However, I saw that most of them watched porn when they were young. I started watching porn relatively late and this now has me wondering whether it’s POCD or I actually am a pedo. I only saw it once, but it doesn’t matter to me. I still watched and masturbated to it and looking back it makes me sick. Also to clarify: I’ve never been attracted to kids, nor have I thought of them in a sexual manner. I also never watched real cp nor do I ever want to. Before this I was completely neutral towards them. Now whenever I see a kid I get so anxious I try to get away from them as fast as I can. I have this voice in my head that tells me I’m a monster and a danger to them. I hate this feeling. I hate myself. I wish I could go back and stop myself from ever falling into that hole. I want to go back to feeling normal so badly. I don’t want to associate myself with those disgusting predators, but the voice in my head keeps screaming that I’m just as bad as them. I feel that I’m permanently tainted and deserve to live the rest of my life alone. No one else in my life knows what I’m dealing with and I’m too scared to open up or get help. This is the first time I’m actually writing about this and I feel terrified, but hearing about other people dealing with POCD, I feel that I should get this off of my chest. I am considering seeking help but the thought of opening up to a therapist is so terrifying to me. I’ve never been diagnosed with OCD before. Anyways, thanks for listening to my vent. Any advice is appreciated. I really hope I can get out of this hellhole that I’ve created for myself.",
      "Hi, I'm 21 and I've gone through very similar things you have, but I was a lot younger. It started with cartoons involving characters that I've grown up with and they still mess with me pretty badly just thinking about it. I don't even remember how I discovered porn but I know I was pretty much a little kid. It didn't get bad until high school, and that's when it all started. Porn overall made me an awful person. I got very addicted to watching porn and it led to a lot of different taboos that I still think about and have shame over. I get false memories and bad memories overall of just watching pornography and I feel very disgusted with myself because of how far it took me. I try to tell myself that it wasn't in my control at such a young age and that I shouldn't define myself by this, but I can't help but feel disgusting anyway. Unfortunately a lot of us that go through POCD have been exposed to pornography when we were really young. 17 is young as well. You were still underaged and you didn't have any knowledge or experience with this stuff. It can mess with you at basically any age. I've been doing my best to stay away from it all and it's still hard. You aren't alone though. I'm really sorry that happened to you.",
      "I had a similar experience. Except with fanfiction and it wasn't just once. I don't want to get too philosophical, but here is my take: We as a society were not prepared for the wide-spread availability of porn and the effects it can have on teenagers. At 17 your brain is not at all fully developed. At 19 your brain is not at all fully developed. Even at 21 most people's brains are not fully developed. And nobody even talks to teenagers about WHY porn use is bad, it's always under the \"all sex is bad\" umbrella. I see people say \"forgive youself\" all the time. That hasn't been helpful to me. Instead, I would recommend  just sitting in the anxiety and discomfort. It's hard, but it's the only way through it."

      "Real or not? I might end it all Trigger Warning: CP I am really freaking out right now and I'm on the edge. Last year I have had thoughts about watching r(pe scenes from shows I have watched(all legal ones). Some of the victims were teenagers (13-17) and some shows were with real actors. I'm now getting convinced that because of the real actors it is considered real cp. At one point I think I'm being silly. They are actors, nobody got abused on the set, it is just fictional. I also told my therapist about it and she didn't call any cops or claimed that it is a crime. I also did not watch these scenes despite having such thoughts. I understand why I had these thoughts. When I was 15-16 yrs old I was highly sexual curious so anything involving that made me curious. And when I really wanted to watch sex scenes I watched scenes from shows with adult characters (with consent). But Idk I'm now really freaking out. Is it considered real cp? How am I any different from the predators who watch real cp? I'm considering turning myself in because of how much the thought of it being the latter kills me (and no, I don't give a $#%^ if that makes me a p or not, I'm terrified that I thought of literally committing a terrible, awful crime). Somebody please help me!",
      "Hey there, reassurances won't make it better, but I don't think you are a criminal, pervert, or anything other than a normal teenager. REAL cp is actually really hard to come across fortunately."

      "Hi, I want to keep this quick. I have had what I hope to be HOCD from 21 to 24. It has been the worst mental agony I have ever gone through compared to my other anxiety and OCD themes, and it is so central to my identity. I don't want to bore you with my life details, as I have posted on here before, so I want to run through some questions I have and hear your thoughts on what we really think this is from an outside perspective. I'll separate all of them into different categories, and let me know your thoughts. Pro-OCD Side: -Have had an anxiety disorder since I was 11 and other OCD issues before (nothing this intense, though) -this is complete torture and agony for me -the idea of getting it on with a girl or cuddling with one causes me an uneasy feeling and makes me feel disgusted, but I get a strong groinal response -I spend hours online in forums  and on OCD websites over this topic -I have always crushed on men, had sexual fantasies about men, had many celebrity crushes on men, was one of the boy-crazy friends, and always envisioned myself marrying a man -Everything LGBT-related never made me uncomfortable before this set in - I went to a pride festival before, I hungout with my gay family friend and her girlfriend, and I watched TV shows with LGBTQ characters without worrying -I have a boyfriend who I deeply love, and we have amazing sex, but of course, In ocd fashion, my relationship is constantly picked apart -I have been sexual with over 15 men - many of which were in college during my very boy-crazy phase. -I have always loved flirting with men and male attention (sadly, this went away as the obsession kicked in) -I get a groinal response even hearing the word lesbian or seeing a woman in a bikini which has never happened to me before and seems like a not-so-natural reaction of a true gay person -all my childhood journals and diaries were writing about men (I compulsively dug them up to check) -I get wet when I give my boyfriend oral sex -the idea of going down on a girl makes me cringe -I can't recall any girl from my HS or college who I had a crush on (my OCD really tries to find something but to no avail) -I have been absolutely heartbroken over men and cried my eyes out about breakups and them not liking me back -I compulsively knock on things 4 times to make sure I don't turn lesbian -stupid, I know -I have had multiple breakdowns over this, and it haunts me every day. I really don't want to marry and start a life with a woman, but my brain says I will like it once I stop fighting it. -I have not had one day since it started which I have had a break from these thoughts and desperately want the old me back -I never had a problem with finding women hot or sexy because I knew I liked men and can appreciate beauty -If I was to be gay I think I would always mourn my straight self and really would miss my old attraction and who I was -lesbians have hit on me before and asked me on dates, and I felt uncomfortable and politely declined. Possibly LES: -I watched a lesbian sex scene in a movie as a kid and got really aroused -it was a dirty movie with straight sex scenes as well that made me aroused -I get nervous now being nice to good-looking women in fear I may start liking them -I get offended by gay slurs now that didn't bother me before -my boyfriend has lesbian friends I get super uncomfortable around -I watched girls kissing and masturbating to it at 14 and then switched to straight and lesbian porn. I thought it made me bisexual to do this but found out a lot of my friends watched it too later on, and they are all straight. I would also fantasize about men a lot during it. -I'm way less attracted to men's bodies than I use to be -I'm 90% less attracted to men than I use to be, which breaks my heart -I worry I was almost so attracted to men to overcompensate for something (unknowingly) which I know sounds so stupid -I worry if me and my boyfriend break up I will want to start dating woman -I experimented with my friend at 13 -I watched videos on youtube regarding lesbian couples for one afternoon when I was in middle school -One time, I went to a club with my friends and couldn't find any men, and then a girl came up to me and said I was pretty, and I joked to my friend that I should go home with her, which made me spike. -I get an insane amount of groinal responses -I one time got curious about lesbian Tinder and switched my profile and really didn't find any of the girls attractive, so I left. -I never considered myself 100% straight but always knew I liked men, so it never bothered me -I kissed my friends drunk sometimes because I love the attention from men - I was never thinking about them and always getting excited that men would love it. -I one time was having bad sex with a man (around 19) and had the thought, \"Am I a lesbian?\" pass my mind, and then the sex got better, so I brushed it off. It seemed like an intrusive thought at the time. I tried to get through everything, and that's most of it. Let me know what you think sounds like OCD and what doesn't. Even typing this out made me feel a little better because it made me realize a lot of the things on the lesbian side were fairly small events, but I would love to know your thoughts.",

Hello, I'm a 36 year old man that's suffered from HOCD since age 19. This obsession first hit me in May 2006 and burdened my life for over a decade. However, the obsessions have largely subsided over the past 6 months or so. I recommend that you see a therapist that specializes in OCD. This is an irrational fear that feeds on doubt. You have to challenge these thoughts everyday as they're invalid.",
      "Hi, I'm having an awful time this week. I live with roommates but actually had to go home because of how bad it got. I kept having panic attacks where I practically convinced myself.

I feel awful this week, and this is the worst my mental health has been. My brain also feels like a sponge-like where everything I read suddenly applies to me. I have no idea who I am and who I use to be. Also, the groinal responses have stopped me from wanting to go to the grocery store, being around my roommate, and looking people in the eye. I feel like I'm constantly noticing the same sex. I practically feel like I'm going crazy. How did you cope with your really really bad weeks.

I've had this for three years, and it hasn't felt this bad since when it started. I'm starting to loose insight. Sorry for the delay. I'm glad I checked this site though. I'll answer as best I can 1. I started therapy for OCD in 2012 and 2015. However, I did not seek treatment for HOCD until 2019. My therapist used Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) during our sessions. However, I would expose myself to images of attractive men to dismantle the intrusive thoughts. There is a difference between checking to satisfy the obsession and exposure to treat the disorder. 2. I've had weeks where I thought the thoughts were real, particularly when this obsession first hit me in 2006. OCD caused me to question multiple memories to look for evidence of homosexuality. 3. I haven't had bad weeks, but certainly bad moments or days when the thoughts seemed too real. In the early days (2006-2008) I visited OCD sites and chatted with people suffering HOCD as it provided reassurance. However, I lived with the thoughts and the impact and spikes slowly subsided over the decade. I now have far fewer spikes, though they still occur. However, I've nearly conquered my HOCD. Do not give up and keep practicing your mental exercises. You can beat this irrational obsession.",
      "To me the fact that you're writing all of this and analyzing it to death + how much agony it's causing you is clear indication that this is OCD. I'm intimately familiar with OCD, unfortunately, and this screams of it. The obvious answer here is the one that everyone else will see, but will be impossible for you to. I know this because I've been caught in the grips of OCD before and have a good friend who has been too. The obvious answer is that you've taken nothing and blown it up into something based on anxiety and fear. And the answer is that in the end it doesn't even matter either way. (not to say that it doesn't matter to you, or you don't matter - but that in the end it's fine whatever sexual orientation you are, whether gay straight or somewhere in between). This truly shouldn't cause you agony. And given that it does and how much you're overthinking this, I believe that this is an OCD reaction of you being scared you might not be straight or might not know your true identity. I've had similar OCD spirals and I feel like whenever I get out of the thing I was spiralling on, I look back later and it seems so strange that I spun out on it for so long. But it's hard to see the truth when you're so deep inside of it. The best way to find the answer to this is to not worry what the answer is, then it will become obvious to you. But trying to solve a problem while you're still spinning out in the problem is near impossible. A healthy lifestyle (eating well, working out, therapy, friends & family), time and distance will give you the answer. Analyzing it to death will not. Giving you love and wishing you the best!"

      "Hi, Just wanted to ask if anyone has experienced the same thing? Sometimes for instance a word will tigger an OCD thought, like if I’m listening to the radio, etc. Has anyone experienced this. Also sometimes I get intrusive thoughts sort of related to my themes, but not really. Is this just a way OCD can manifest? Thanks",
      "What kind of thought does the word trigger? Are you simply repeating the word in your head? A lot of intrusive thoughts will center around a myriad of themes. Yes, OCD can manifest in themes as you might have noticed here. Within the limits of what you described, yes, it is common to OCD.",
      "I used to get words or phrases stuck in my head when I was younger, as a mild way of OCD manifesting itself. It was a lot like getting a song stuck in your head, but obviously unusual. Now I do find certain words/topics trigger fears or bad memories which then causes a wave of anxiety. I've gotten a lot better at riding out the anxiety though and deciding not to react to it. It's really hard, but really worth it. It's the main way I've been able to improve my life and reduce my OCD. All the best!"

      "What happened yesterday (Sexual OCD, please read guys) I want to share you guys my entire thought process and every thing that been on my mind and happening and how yesterday was the worst the day of my life [The start] So I’ve never done well in school and I failed my first year of college, now I’m in a repeat year and I’ve finally found the motivation and the drive to get all of my work done, this is the last week of work till I’m done college and I’ve been pulling all nighters just excited to be able to move out and progress, I was really excited about this and now I was almost close to finishing it, I had so much motivation So I came home from college ready to do my work and finish my remaining assignments. I started them and went to my room afterwards to take a little break, in that little break I went to masturbate, and this, this was the worst mistake of my life to date The masturbation went fine at the start, and because of my HOCD I was avoiding stuff like with penises in it because my worst fear is accidentally masturbating to one, I was at it for about 20 minutes and then I accidentally stumbled across a penis and got massive anxiety (which wasn’t that bad in hindsight compared to what happened next) and kept checking to make sure I didn’t like it So I move on and keep at it (I’m on Reddit btw) then someone posts trans porn and I get another sexual reaction which sets me off and almost gives me a panic attack, I keep checking and checking, and I go on a checking spree watching stuff that I don’t like to reassure my sexuality and it goes horribly wrong And then at one point I get numb, I should state that I didn’t actually get erect from anything I saw I just had heavy sexual sensations. So while I’m numb I say to myself you know what, let me face my fears and masturbate to straight porn, which I had been avoiding because of penises, I just straight up start masturbating to it and then I feel something when I see the penis and it just makes everything so so so much worse When masturbating to the straight porn I feel different sensations looking at the woman and then seeing the penis, looking at woman I feel normal arousal but when I see the penis I feel like I’m about to climax fast, probably because of my anxiety and then it dawns on me that I essentially masturbated to a penis, my worst fear This destroys me and right now I’m in bed, I have no more motivation to finish my assignments, I was so close to, for everything to be perfect but I let one moment of horniness mess everything up for me, I don’t know what to do anymore. If I had just masturbated for like 5 minutes this would never have happened, I would never have had to see that stuff. Damn",
      "Maybe seeing the penis in straight porn kind of put you in that place in the imagery?  I mean, if someone's watching hetero porn, they're going to be attracted to one sex and identify with the other, surely.  I mean, we're talking about OCD and if you're like me, you overthink things.",
      "Hey This might be a bit late but hope you're feeling better about this and have managed to put it behind you. As someone with OCD I can totally see how you would build this up into something in your head. I guarantee if you didn't care so much about it that the whole thing would go away instantly. OCD is ultimately a doubting disease. It makes you doubt things that can be hard for someone without OCD to understand. I've heard of some people even doubting concrete things like if they have a penis or not, and then have to reassure themselves by checking all the time. Or people who think they might have got HIV from their penis touching a toilet. It's the same reason someone with OCD will check that their door is locked several times, or in this case, check to make sure you aren't aroused by penises several times. I truly believe the best way out of OCD is by slowly building that commitment to trusting yourself and riding out the anxiety that comes after by not reassuring yourself about something. The more you reassure yourself, the deeper you dig yourself into an OCD anxious loop. Conversely, the more you ride out the wave of anxiety and trust yourself, the less your anxiety will be around whatever it is that's stuck in your mind, and the easier and easier it gets to choose to trust yourself and not let anxiety drive your actions. From an outside perspective, it's easy for someone else to look at what you're worrying about and say 'so what?'. In this case it's true as well. So what if you are attracted to penises? You're obviously attracted to women, so even if you are bisexual would it really matter? Not at all man. Though knowing how OCD works I'm very confident that you truly aren't attracted to penises, you're just fixated on the fear that you are. Hope you're well man and put in the work to stop acting on your anxieties. Much love"

      "I'm currently not having a good weekend and I'm really upset with myself. I'm constantly feeling guilt and shame for my low self esteem and my intrusive thoughts about real events and POCD. I also have problems with harm but not as much as the two I listed above. I use an app for my intrusive thoughts and it helps at times but at other times like these it can be really triggering and I just feel really horrible in the end. There was this post that involved an adult woman with a foot fetish and she felt a lot of anxiety because she came across something that has to do with a teenager's feet. She told me she didn't do anything to it and she was really worried about it but also knows it's an older video and the person she was talking about was way older. To me she sounded like someone who was going through POCD and I actually have several things in common with her. I also have a foot fetish and have unfortunately encountered similar scenarios where I felt worry. However, when reading about who she was I couldn't help but get this extreme amount of arousal because a woman around my age or older with a foot fetish is one of my biggest turn ons. I hated to see her struggling with this and since she deleted her post and probably her account, I just feel bad. After this, someone who claimed to be a friend of hers posted this same story and I responded to it to know if she was okay and that from what she told me, it was all OCD and that she shouldn't worry. Then that person deleted the post and now I'm just confused about it all but I also feel really bad. I feel bad that not only this woman is suffering like this but I feel bad because I got so much arousal from this at the wrong place and wrong time. The arousal lasted for the entire night and then I kept fantasizing about the idea of meeting a woman with a foot fetish (not her specifically) and it just felt like I took advantage of this whole situation even though I can't help with what I'm attracted to. I occasionally went back and forth on the app to check if she replied to see if she was okay and had more to say but my mind is constantly twisting this by thinking I wanted to take advantage of this and I got thoughts of us talking about how we have this in common. This didn't happen and I didn't want this to happen but I just kept thinking about it and the arousal behind it would not go away at all. I was NOT AT ALL aroused by the fact that she came across a teenager. That's sick. I had a nightmare about something that was like this with a woman that I thought was an adult initially on a news story completely naked and showing her body, but it turned out she was 16 and I woke up with disgust and shame but with groinals. I had told her about it and how much I hated it. I was just aroused because of the initial person she was. I feel so bad about this and I couldn't sleep or get through the morning today because of what had happened. I just hope that she's okay and she isn't sent into a panic over what had happened to her and whatever her OCD is saying. I feel like a scumbag. I feel like I'm gross and I'm so ashamed of having these feelings and how it escalated to a seperate fantasy that I almost got off to. I can't stand that it aroused me so much and I hate that it did because that person was struggling with this and I feel like I took advantage of this whole thing even though I didn't tell her anything about this or how I felt about her having a foot fetish. It wouldn't have related to what she was going through and it would have been weird. It would have been pointless. I'm trying to tell myself that OCD is twisting things and that I can't help what I'm attracted to but it's hard. The feelings are still here and I feel disgusting about it."

      "First I would like to start off by saying I am finally able to afford help so I am going to try and get some appointments going ASAP for this it has gotten so bad this week and I would really appreciate some help getting me through this even if it seems repetitive. This recent spike happened because I was watching a romcom anime and I wasn't able to insert as the mc like I believe I was able to in the past. However, I grew attached to the characters and I am unsure if I genuinely liked the female characters or not I also worry that I was jealous of the female characters. There was also a femboy/trap character that I worry I was attracted to more on this character later. When the anime ended is when the problems really started to get much, much worse. I immediately started to flat out feel depressed and started wishing I could just go back to \"normal\" if I was ever straight to begin with. I started getting really depressed thinking about the main female because think I found her attractive, but I just don't know and thinking about it just hurts. I ended up testing again and again and eventually, it led me to hentai of the femboy and the mc and I never orgasmed or anything, but I think I felt some kind of arousal? Anyways, I was masturbating using my fantasies instead of using porn and it felt really difficult to go anywhere and then my mind switched to a panel of the hentai of the guys penis which was stupid massive and it instantly sent me to the brink of orgasm which I did. I also tried to just masturbate to porn like normal the next day and it was going ok and the same thing basically happened where a bunch of penises appeared on screen and it made me orgasm. I also have had some forgotten memories re-emerge that is making this much worse too. I can remember when I was in I think 2nd grade a boy from my class was having to stay at my house for an extended period of time and I got excited and ended up kissing him and I don't remember if it was cheek or lips. I can also remember at one point feeling a friends erection on my butt and I felt like I enjoyed it. I was also into some really weird things when I was younger like for some reason the scene in rambo 2 when he had the leeches on him turned me on. Another thing was me and a group of friends were playing around in a basement and can't exactly remember what happened, but I remember being made fun of for \"humping\" someone. I also made the discovery that I have always kind of had a fear of being gay without knowing it and would try my hardest not to expose myself to anything that could prove it to me and this also worries me that I have been repressing it in some way this whole time. I don't understand why I chased after girls and longed for them was it because of compulsive heterosexuality? What? I feel like I've been living a lie and everything I thought I knew about myself has been wrong and that I will never be with a girl and have a family... This was a really long post and I apologize for that, but any help with these things would be very much appreciated while I try and get professional help I really feel like I'm at my wits end here. -- Tue May 23, 2023 2:27 am -- I should also add that I am always getting jealous of other guys for their bodies and looks and I read somewhere that its common among repressed and in denial gay men to do that.",
      "I even had the urge to seek out girls when I was a preteen and would often try to and would get shy and bashful when one would talk to me. Hell, I even remember when I confessed my feelings to a girl when I was 16 and I felt so many butterflies and all that and was super excited when she reciprocated and I felt like I was on top of the world. Would a repressed/closeted/in denial gay guy do any of this? What if that was all just some twisted form of compulsive heterosexuality or heteronormativity? Ugh I'm in such a mess right now and I almost want to cry, but I either can't or won't. No offense to the LGBT community, but I really don't want to be gay and am terrified of the thought... Again I apologize for the length and ranty nature, but I really feel like I need to get this out there and off my chest and I hope I get a good therapist that wont cause me to have a breakdown. One more thing before I go to bed. If I am gay and have been this whole time why don't I want a relationship with a guy and why don't I fantasize about all that comes with it"

      "It's me again. I saw my ex high school bully in traffic. I beeped my horn and flipped the bird and yelled profanities at her. Not a proud moment of mine but in the past she has assaulted me. I remember my heart racing but feeling good for getting back at her eventhough it wasn't face to face. I was in my car. I don't even know if she saw me. She drove off and I continued to turn right on to a d8fferent road. I dropped my daughter off at the train station. I do feel bad yelling abuse in front of my daughter. Now my brain is saying I got out of the car after I dropped my daughter off and killed this woman. But how? How when she drove off and I continues f9r about another 500 metres before I dropped my girl off. Then I poured gas. Then came home. How and when did I kill her? She also lives a street away yet my ocd isn't getting better. I parked my car a few doors up from her place to see if she comes out of her house to see if she's alive. What do I do?",
      "You don't stalk her and you make yourself ignore the thoughts.  When I think I've done something, I make myself ignore it.",
      "But Snaga, how do I know I didn't kill her? My heart races when I wake up. I feel sick. I can't ignore the thoughts cause I believe the thoughts. I spoke to my psych who said that I need to distract myself. I've been going to the beach, gardening etc and she's on my mind. She lives a street away. Do I sit in my car and wait for her to leave her house? This is killing me",
      "You know you didn't kill her because you didn't kill her.  You'd know if you'd done such a thing, and likely everyone else would know it by now, as well.",
      "I don't remember how I killed her which means I mustn't have done it. It's been a week and I'm still scared and thinking the police will come.",
      "And they haven't, so....",
      "Thanks for your quick reply. I guessing worried about going to jail. It's part of my harm ocd. I keep telling everyone I know to just knock.on her door and see if she's ok but they won't do it. I guess they know she's fine and it's just my ocd that's talking sheet! I'm sick of being scared. I need to trust my family and my psych and ignore these thoughts. Like you said, ignore them.",
      "Like anything, it takes practice, and you practice it by doing it.",
      "So I gave in to the thoughts. I parked a few doors up from her house. Waited 2 hours and didn't see her come out ,gave up and drove home. I broke down at home and told my family where I was. Just sitting in the car, scrolling instagram. I wasn't acting suspicious but I won't do it again. Don't want to be accused of stalking even though it's a public road. Many people sit in their cars to talk on their phones, smoke cigarettes etc. Now my thought has changed. Did she come out and I blacked out and did hurt her? For goodness sake, I was in my car. I didn't leave my car. Noone came.to my car. I didn't see her. I think it's best I didn't see her. I'm not going to park in her street again",
      "I know it's hard but you have to let it go.  I had a situation just other day while driving that triggered my OCD and I had to ask the other person with me 'did I hit them?' and ofc the answer was No, but I had to ask twice before I got it out of my system just enough to beat down my OCD from letting it continue.  And I had to fight myself from the urge to go back and check.  While all the time I know if I'd hit something I would have known it you don't hit something big and not know it.  Not even something little, you know it you feel it.  I know that rationally but OCD is not rational.  So... I sucked it up and I let it go .  You GOT to let this the hell go.  Just stop it. I've been through this kind of thing for me it's when driving.  One time saw an unexpected pedestrian late at night, then worry I hit them, then circle back around to check and of course that means I see them again and then what?  They realise it's the same car and think I'm stalking her?  Did I hit them this time?  Do I check again?  Will they get my tag number?  Will the police come to my house?  What if I don't check? And every time you check, it creates a new instance to worry about having done something.  And before you know it you're telling me you're stalking their house for reassurance.  If you're that concerned about it go knock on the door and under the guise of apologising for yelling and giving them the middle finger (because you need something other than 'my OCD is acting up), and if that isn't to your taste then the only other thing is to let this madness go and decide to stop it now.  And that's the better solution because as soon as you get through with your 'apology' you'll go home and then worry you blacked out and killed them at the front door.  And then you'll need to check again.  And again and again and again, until you do what you know you need to do and tell yourself This Ends Now.  Worry about having killed them or hurt them, after you've been arrested, not before.  Defer the anxiety.  That's what I do, I defer my anxiety.  I'll worry about hurting or killing someone, when the law shows up at my door.  Not before.  I'll have plenty of time to panic about it then, why should I do it now when I don't even have any proof I've done anything?  So stop giving in to this madness and start making yourself let it go.  It's hard, very hard, but it can be done, and the more you do it, the easier it gets to do it. You really have no choice, every time you do something to reassure yourself, you're just digging yourself a deeper hole to have to get out of."

      "I know I keep making posts about this and I’m sorry but I’m truly having a mental breakdown right now, this is absolutely killing me internally, I’m really on the verge of just ending it all Yesterday I tried to watch straight porn because I had been afraid of seeing penises, so I slapped on a random porn video and just tried to masturbate like I used to. The reason I started the whole ERP in the first place was because I kept getting groinal responses every time I saw a penis in porn and I decided I’m going to know once and for all and when I did this ERP I had no anxiety and felt numb because I had another bad HOCD incident before that so I was already hindering on being mentally broken I watched the porn and when the penis came on the screen I felt a rush of arousal while masturbating like I was going to climax fast but it also felt very weird it wasn’t the same arousal I got from looking at the woman and then I ended up climaxing the woman What confuses me the most and others might see this as a cope is that the penis in question was from a cartoon (it was hentai) and it was drawn in a way that it wasn’t supposed to be attractive it literally just a circle and a round rectangle, it was obvious the focus of the video was for straight men the dude didn’t even have a face, so why did I react like that? Oh my God, it wasn’t until this morning that the numbness wore off and I realized that I essentially masturbated to a penis and now I honestly no joke feel like I’m dying, this is the first time this has made me cry"

      "It's my first time posting such a stuff so I'm sorry if I'm doing mistakes in explaining. I am male who only started his adult life, I'm going to finish university soon, never had a gf before (Only had one but it was a long distance relationship which ended up with broke up because I knew it would happen one day). Maybe it's OCD or not but I had HOCD before which I can say was real because I had intense fear of being one but I don't know how but I managed to easily overcome by just saying to myself \"I'm not the one because I would never do that in reality\" and it easily vanished but it easily appeared when this whole stuff started. While I was sitting in my room and chilling I had a converstation with my friend and suddenly I felt spikes of stress with a thoughts \"I'm a pedophile\". It gave me a huge stress and anxiety. My mother and dad calmed me down and said it's ok don't worry you didn't harmed anyone it's just an silly stuff but I kept processing the whole stuff in the past which I rubbed an itch to. I've seen loli hentai (you know the fictional underage characters), had few text ERP with such a disgusting stuff because I was seeking an attention and always felt in a trap of meeting disgusting and weird people on internet. I learned different stuff how to overcome the fear of it and they worked on me but I still feel the disgusting thoughts and urges like \"I wanna *** one\" or \"You're enjoying them why don't you do it?\". I'm having a huge anxiety but when I calm myself down I feel that maybe I'm enjoying it or not? It's giving me an pushback to anxiety because I start checking and reassuring that I'm not but it doesn't helps me because I understand that I feel in my own mind trap. At one moment I did a test and masturbated to it again, I finished quickly but felt disgust how did I managed to do it again to such a stuff. Every person who I trust told me to calm down and stop trying to find a solution to a problem because they see me as a normal person. They never seen me looking or acting weird near the kids. And I agree with them because I could easily talk or play with them when I was in the mood but mostly I was ignorant and didn't cared about them because they always annoyed me and it's easy to make me angry because I don't like when someone acts like an idiot around me. I don't know how to understand anything of this. Maybe I'm a freak or just an idiot who doesn't understands himself? Everyone gave me an advice \"As long you don't harm anyone or seek for real one's it's ok because you didn't done anything wrong to anyone and it's not your fault that such a stuff can be easily found on the internet\". Sometimes I remind myself about those advices and facts but they work for a short moment before it comes back and keeps giving me those immoral thoughts which I would never act on because I don't wanna feel or see anything like that because it would ruin my whole world. Nowadays I'm feeling weird because I'm feeling that I like kids more but I never had it in the past, I always enjoyed shy and intellegent females which was I looking for.",

      "Whenever I masturbate to normal straight porn it takes seemingly forever to finish, but if I think about the penis I seem to come to orgasm very quick. I even come very close when watching gay porn when I test it feels like. I was getting by ok until the thought popped into my head again recently and brought this issue back to the forefront of my mind again and I'm having a ton of anxiety all over again worried that I really am gay. And even more confusing and frustrating for me is that I almost always think about women, yet it seems like I don't really get aroused by them and instead get aroused by men",
      "I really do hope this is just HOCD because I just can't imagine myself living a gay lifestyle and have never imagined that which also makes me worry that I never considered it because of pressure to be straight or something like that",
      "You have 45 posts so I'm sure you've covered this ground before and may have heard what I am going to say... Porn will F-up everything. It is the WORST kind of testing one can do (not that there is any good kind of testing) and will magnify the confusion tenfold.",
      "No testing, please no testing....",
      "Sorry to hijack, but what is OCD \"testing\"?  Tried to google, unsuccessfully.",
      "Testing means \"to test\" a theory one might be obsessing over. For instance, if I am obsessed that I could be losing my eyesight (even though there are no symptoms) I might spend my time \"testing\" by looking at small text on a screen, or seeing how my eyes adjust after the lights are turned off, etc. In other words, it is the actions we take to see if our irrational thoughts are true or not. Testing doesn't work because a brain suffering high volumes of anxiety will never trust any answer that testing reveals. Reduce the anxiety and you reduce the irrational thoughts.",

Often times they will search for more taboo things to get aroused. Many heterosexual people will watch gay porn to become aroused, or some other kind of thing. Not because they are gay but because the taboo nature of it (to them) arouses them. Testing in general doesn't work. Test with porn is even worse, as I mentioned.",

      "Hi so I've seen a lot of talk about pure o ocd but is it possible to have pure c? My other half has ocd (diagnosed) its been a long time since they have voice any obsessions and they are generally prity good about letting me know if they are struggling with thoughts (we don't discuss what the thoughts are unless they want to, they just tell me their head is \"noisy\" so I'm on standby to comfort if/when they need it) Thing is I've noticed an increase in compulsive behaviour; hording, repetitive movement, vocalisation. From what I have understood compulsive behaviors are used to ward off intrusive thoughts. If there have been no intrusive thoughts in a while could the compulsive behaviors themselves become an obsession (i have to do these or the bad thoughts come back sort of thing) Would this endless cycle of compulsive behaviors for the sake of performing  compulsive behaviors be classed as pure c ocd?"

      "Hello! For the record, I am an ex-HOCD sufferer. I have not officially been diagnosed, but I was here years ago, about 2015, because I had what I could only consider \"HOCD\". I used to ruminate, check images, groinal response, visit this forum frequently, all that good stuff. I suffered in silence for almost a year. I never sought official help, but instead did my best to practice mindfulness and how to do ERP on my own from what I learned online. It took a long time. It was slow and uncomfortable, but I did recover! Those thoughts that used to send me into a panic attack no longer bother me. I remember thinking how I'd be stuck like that forever. I wish I could access my old posts, but I don't even know if my account is around anymore. Either way, I'm HOCD free! So it is possible and it gets better. Just have to put in the painstaking work. I truly thought this was a weird one-off thing in my life. Maybe I didn't have OCD but maybe a general anxiety disorder, so once that had stopped bothering me, I stopped worrying about it and thought I returned to 'normal'. But years later, I'm beginning to think I should seek professional help, because I fear I've adopted a new obsession. It gets worse and worse everday as I try to rationalize it. I don't want to go into too much detail about it because I am not seeking reassurance, but it's basically a form of \"relationship\" OCD and a fear of my partner changing. The thoughts are a bit specific, but they did not bother me once upon a time, and I'd like to return to that. If I've conquered Pure-O once I can do it again, but I've just forgotten how. Does anyone have any advice, steps I should follow, anything I can read or watch to help me out? The best I remember is that I would just \"agree\" with the thoughts and let them go, but I know there was more to that. Any help is appreciated! Thank you!",
      "Hello PS I think it is called ROCD, with relationships being the theme. And, as I have said in other threads, at the heart of it, when we suffer anxiety the theme really doesn't matter because the anxiety will leap from leap theme to theme because the anxiety is present. But I understand this issue is particular to you. If you have assessed that your thoughts are irrational and part of anxiety, that's half the battle. And you are correct in thinking that one of the ways to combat these kinds of things is to just \"agree\" with the thought and move on. I tell myself to play through it. I have a big question for you. Does your partner know you suffer from anxiety, the kind of sort that can produce OCD symptoms?",
      "I wish I could access my old posts, but I don't even know if my account is around anymore. It should be pretty easy to find your old posts, just search your old username and when you find one just click on the username to view your profile."

      "Hi, You may remember me I posted a few months back on the forums. obsessive-compulsive/topic221385.html I'm struggling immensely right now. Me and my boyfriend have been dating since October. I really do love him (or do I?), and I've never had better sex with someone in my whole life. He makes me laugh, the sex is amazing, He has given me my first orgasms from just penetration (sorry, TMI), I feel a spark and butterflies 90% of the time we kiss. But here's the thing I find it a little suspicious that the best relationship I have ever been in is during this god-awful HOCD phase. Like does this mean I'm actually lying and forcing these reactions? Also, I've seen people say that their OCD has disappeared when they are in relationships, but mine has just gotten stronger and stronger the more I've fallen in love. I'm terrified to lose him, but I also wonder if my anxiety would lessen without him. I feel tremendous guilt being with him while searching for hours a day, whether I'm gay or not. I miss my old self so much, where I was boy-crazy and super comfortable with all things sexuality. Without HOCD, I feel like I would be thriving right now. I mourn the loss of my early twenties due to this illness and wish I could go back to my old self so badly, but that girl almost feels like a stranger to me. I don't know what I felt like, but I knew I felt natural. Why won't OCD just accept I'm not gay? Bisexual, I could deal with it, but I don't feel inclined to be with women at all. Also, with reassurance, it use to work for me for almost a whole day. I would find some really good insight and relax for hours on end. Now I swear it only works for maybe 30 minutes on a good day. I've gone so deep into the rabbit whole that I've found posts of people with HOCD turning out to be gay. How common do you think this is? I truly can't accept my worst fears are possible and don't want to live my life with that. That's not me! Instead of working today, I spent much of my time on forums and balled my eyes out in my pillow after work. I'm also avoiding my boyfriend right now. At the beginning of our relationship, when I was with him, my HOCD thoughts practically disappeared when we were together, but when spending longer weekends with him, they now creep in around him. I almost had a panic attack during sex once with him because I was struggling with the thoughts so badly that day. The awful thing, too, is I basically lost all attraction to men and feel groinals in front of women. I never had an issue with finding women sexy before and would drool practically over men and constantly want to have sex with them. I was the boy crazy friend!!! I will admit I've had bicurious moments, but it's nothing too crazy. The thing that really triggers me is my friend from HS breaking up with her boyfriend of 2 years in college and is now a lesbian. Like, what the actual ###$. And to make matters worse, she seemed so in love with him!!! I WANT MY LIFE BACK NOW! I've become a bad friend, lost my passion for pretty much everything, lock myself in my room all day, and only care about this. How likely do you think it is that my worst-case scenario - being a lesbian? Is going to come true, or is true? Aren't there lots of lesbians who aren't happy about it and wish it went away as well? How am I different than them? Can society hetronormativity be so strong that it convinced you you liked boys. Also I don't have many lgbtq friends but do you think people discover they're gay in their early 20's or is this incredibly rare. Like wouldn't I know the first time i kissed men, had sex many times with them, and dated a lot that i didn't like it? So sorry for the long rant I'm crying while typing this but if anyone has any insights into these questions i would greatly appreciate it. I have never experience such guilt, anxiety, depression, and most of all grief in my whole life.",
      "Me and my boyfriend have been dating since October. I really do love him (or do I?), and I've never had better sex with someone in my whole life. He makes me laugh, the sex is amazing, He has given me my first orgasms from just penetration (sorry, TMI), I feel a spark and butterflies 90% of the time we kiss. I have plenty of friends who are lesbians. Some of them had male partners into their teens. I have heard their stories about this time in their lives. NOT ONE would EVER describe being with a man the way you do above, especially the bolded part. Why won't OCD just accept I'm not gay? OCD is not a separate being. You shouldn't try to convince it because there isn't an IT to convince. It is the by-product/symptom of anxiety. It is a disorder. Like wouldn't I know the first time i kissed men, had sex many times with them, and dated a lot that i didn't like it? One of my friends kissed a boy for the first time and immediately knew it wasn't for her. Another friend knew when she was 10 and hadn't kissed anyone. Here is the reality. If you have been diagnosed, you have to get with your therapist/Psych and find a better solution. If you are not seeing anyone, consider it. If you want to keep trying to \"figure it out\" you can do that too but I would hate to see you suffer any longer than you need to. Good luck.",
      "What Otter said.  You're not a lesbian and having the best sex of your life with this guy both at the same time, one of them's gotta go, and you're having the good sex, so that leaves being a lesbian is the loser in this contest. Which, if you were, you'd have an itch that wasn't being scratched.  I'm bisexual.  I have an itch that doesn't get scratched, and I know it.  'Cause it bloody well itches! hocdgirl1313 wrote: I find it a little suspicious that the best relationship I have ever been in is during this god-awful HOCD phase. Oh I don't.  The better something's going, I'd think the more your anxiety is going to freak out over it.  That seems to be par for the course, a lot of times, here.  When you've got it bad enough, the mere fact of not being anxious, seems to be enough to make visitors here anxious.  Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying this is something we do on purpose, but it has occurred to me more than once that sometimes anxiety disorders sure do seem to act much like a physical addiction: our brains often seem to seek out something anything to be anxious about. hocdgirl1313 wrote: Why won't OCD just accept I'm not gay? Otter wrote: OCD is not a separate being. You shouldn't try to convince it because there isn't an IT to convince. It is the by-product/symptom of anxiety. It is a disorder. Otter is right.  You can't reason with your disorder.  I'm going to depart from Otter, however, in a way.  With some of my intrusive thoughts (harm thoughts), I have found it helpful to treat my OCD as if it were a separate being.  It's this thing that lives in my head- it has squatter's rights, I can't evict it.  But it lives on fear.  So I made it my business to deny it my fear.  Which makes it weaker... That's just a fancy way of saying that without accepting the premise of my intrusive harm thoughts, I did cop the attitude that I would refuse to care about them when they entered my mind.  I rather suspect it was a roundabout backdoor way of applying Exposure and Response Prevention therapy to myself.  But the point I'm making is that you can't reason with your OCD, but for my Harm OCD, it was helpful for me, to treat it as if it was an unwelcome being.  It gave me something to combat.  And in a roundabout way, for my Harm thoughts, it could be argued since that intrusive thoughts are ego-dystonic (the opposite of what you intend to do or be), yeah they're kinda not the real 'me', even if they are something completely created by my brain. You can't reason with OCD- to me, you can only out-stubborn it.  My unreasonable anxieties are going to be irrational and inconsolable, and as far as I can tell, the only way I can set mine aside is to take the attitude that I just don't give a rat's ass about them coming true.  Otherwise I can (and do) drive myself insane with worry.",
      "Hello, I really appreciate both of your responses a ton. It means a lot to me that you take so long to reply to people and give such great insights. I tried to stay away from the website as I know this is a compulsion, but something not great happened last night. To preface, I just moved to NYC, which has been my dream since I was about 11. I live with two girls, and one of them is a long-time friend of mine. I recently have developed the fear that If I apply to a new job or make new friends, I'm finally going to meet a woman I like and fall in love with her. Right now, even typing this, I feel like my stomach is starting to turn. I think this whole thing has come with a side of depression because I'm way less interested in fashion, going out with friends, and just all my previously enjoyed activities. Last night I saw my boyfriend, who I can honestly say I feel like a little girl around. I really do love him (once again, my brain has asked, or do I?) Biggest TMI ever, but sex with him has been so amazing because of my ability to get very wet during sex. It has never been as intense as this before. So last night, I was feeling a bit more anxious than normal but nothing out of the usual, and I just could not get wet. He was doing what he has always done, and it just wasn't there. I know I shouldn't spiral about this, but my main worry is he will never be able to make me wet again. Also, when I'm in a calm state of mind, the sex is amazing, but sometimes I become distressed during sex due to the constant intrusive thoughts and analyzing if I'm enjoying it enough. I just want my old life back so so badly. I either had my lesbian realization at 21 or I'm suffering from severe HOCD. My attraction to men doesn't even feel remotely similar to what is was before, and my biggest fear is it will never return, but I just don't have the drive to be with women. Women as friends are amazing, but I just thought of the idea of a woman holding me in her arms and tensed up. Before HOCD too I had no issue what as ever finding women sexy. I could even get a little aroused and thought nothing of it. Now I see a woman in a bra and feel my groin clench up and instantly get flustered. It's so odd, and I don't think a true lesbian would react like that because it's almost to every woman in a sexual position. I miss my boy crazy life so bad. I also am so scared of hurting my boyfriend. Do you think it's irresponsible to be in a relationship while going through this or would I just be punishing myself for not letting myself have any enjoyment? Also do you think its likely I'm going to fall in love with a woman? This isn't me but maybe it is. Thank you so much once again!",
      "First of all, your inability to get aroused is not an indication that you are a lesbian or that you don't enjoy your boyfriend. When the body is suffering a heavy dose of anxiety and, probably, depression, the physical effects can be profound, like not getting aroused and other things. If someone suffers HOCD they suffer OCD. In many cases (which you will find in abundance on this site) people will drift from one \"theme\" to another - HOCD to POCD and then on to other obsessions. In each of these cases, they ALWAYS wish they could go back to the previous theme, which didn't seem as bad as the present one. This makes sense because anxiety is the fear behind the mask. The anxiety is constant. The \"H\" in HOCD is just a flavor, so to speak. Reduce the anxiety (medication, CBT, etc) and you reduce whatever fear the person is suffering from. Do you think it's irresponsible to be in a relationship while going through this No. Absolutely not. However, if he cares about you and he is mature enough to understand, then you should be able to talk to him about it. Have him read-up on anxiety disorders. O.",
      "hocdgirl1313 wrote: Do you think it's irresponsible to be in a relationship while going through this Otter wrote: No. Absolutely not If it were irresponsible to be in a relationship during a sexual or relationship themed OCD, then people like us would never be in relationships.  At some point, you have to live your life. hocdgirl1313 wrote: So last night, I was feeling a bit more anxious than normal but nothing out of the usual, and I just could not get wet. Otter wrote: the physical effects can be profound, like not getting aroused and other things. Second and third that.  Doesn't matter how much 'little Snaga' demonstrates functionality in the early morning, or when we're all alone, just it and me- the moment when others are involved, and I worry about my sexuality, or if I'm attracted to this person, or even just anxiety over if I'll have anxiety, or just anxiety about performing.. well that just kills it.  Your inability to get aroused doesn't have to mean anything except that anxiety is a mean, heartless bitch that will mess your mind every chance you let it.",
      "Hello, I'm back again after trying to stay away (not really though I go on this website almost every day) I want to say thank you again, Snaga and Otter, for responding to my messages and for your insight. I really appreciate it, and it says a lot about your character that you take the time to write such personalized and thoughtful messages to sufferers. Well, I moved to a new city, and I'm definitely still struggling. I think the change, finding my job stressful, and the winter months aren't helping as well. I was also triggered by a couple of Tik Toks, which have contributed to my extra rumination recently. One was a gay guy saying how upset he feels sometimes that he is gay, and another was a girl who said she pretended to be boy-crazy as a teen to cover up her lesbianism. What I can say is I spiked majorly but still had to work, so I pushed it aside until after work. I'm really realizing my OCD won't accept any answer it is given because if I'm too boy-crazy, I'm a lesbian trying to cover something up, and if I'm not, I don't like men. I can win with it. Anyways I want to keep things short here and will post some questions I have below. I have so many things to say but don't want to bother anyone. 1. The only man I'm attracted to at the moment is my boyfriend. When I see him, I just want to touch him, and when we facetime, I get super giddy at how gorgeous I think he is. It kinda worries me though, that I'm not finding other men attractive. In high school and all through college I was always looking at attractive men - I wasn't very picky either. Now when I see a good looking guy and feel nothing it brings a lot of sadness. Like a huge chunk of who I am (or who i thought i was) was taken away from me 2. Whats the difference between an occasional homosexual thought and an inkling of homosexuality. I wont lie and say all my thoughts have been straight and I was always ok with that. I have never been a big believer in people are 100% this or that but what scares me is people will say \"you would have had some sense that you were gay. Like what is some sense - like i think twice I've had a maybe your a lesbian thought before HOCD hit and just ignored it because i knew it was ridiculous as i was already crushing on guys. What is this idea of having and inkling and how does it differ from the occasional thought or short feeling i imagine a lot of heterosexual people have had. 3. What age do you think most people realize they are gay? I feel like 21 would be extremely rare but i guess anything is possible - here again comes the looking into the past for evidence part that tortures me. I would say about 98% of my thoughts, feelings, and experiences have been heterosexual, but that 2% of stuff really drives me over the ledge 4. Do you think it's abnormal that I have been suffering from this form of OCD now for almost three years? As previously mentioned, I have had anxiety issues from a very very young age and I'm currently on medication. I have had small OCD blips that have lasted a couple of weeks like harm ocd and schizoprenia OCD but was always more of a hypochondriac and suffered from panic attacks. I see a lot of people on this board have this theme for a couple of months and then have it move on to something else so I'm surprised I have been stuck on this one fear now for almost three years. It makes me think this is not OCD 5. Here another one and my majorrr spike. Don't a lot of people hope for their gayness to go away. I feel like I'm doing this right now but if I was actually gay and always knew i think i would come around to it. I just want my previous self to come back because I was most happy and I felt like me -I feel natural (is this heteronormativity though or just being straight lol). I also grew up in a liberal city and have never been religious, so there are no moral implications. 6. Heres another spike for me. I do have some societal fears though. I'm really close with all of my female friends who are all straight (straightish I would say because many of them have experimented or watch lesbian porn) If this is true i do worry about my friendships not because i think my friends would judge me but because we always talk about boys and I don't wanna miss out on that with my friends. 7. I use to always talk about men a lot of whenever i found a guy hot would go on about it. Do you think you can be covering up for something without realizing you are doing it? I also found a journal from 6th grade about how to get a guy to like you. (yes i did dig through my old diaries to try and see if i ever wrote about woman as a child - I didn't find anything) 8. I am now also overanalyzing all sensations and feelings. My friend came to visit for my birthday and when we hugged my nipples got hard and i freaked out in my room before we went to the bar. I also use to love giving blow jobs before this obsession started but now whenever i touch my bf penis i worry if I'm liking it enough or I'm attracted enough to male genitalia. However i still love the sex and when we kiss and I feel him against me i feel amazing. Also my roommate got asked out on a date and i literally felt jealous but also think it was my OCD. Like if i was truly a lesbian i don't think i would question having a crush on every female friend i have - ones I've had for years especially 9. I don't think i would have an issue being bisexual but the idea of going down on a woman makes me freeze and get stiff and feel uneasy. Even kissing makes me feel a little uneasy but not awful. Does this sound bisexual - i also use to watch girl's kissing on the internet and masturbate around 14 but switched to regular stuff (I would fantasize about men as well and maybe once in a blue moon a woman) 10. I don't have many lesbian friends - I have one but she triggers me a lot because she like a later in life lesbian i guess (i think shes bisexual but that's another story) but i did have a lesbian family friend i never felt uncomfortable around, watched tv shows with lesbian characters, and it would pain me to see people be homophobic. I never understood why people where homophobic if it was something that doesn't concern them but now i avoid everything gay at all costs. I also hate when people will say \"there's nothing wrong with being gay\" like i absolutely know this but it does feel wrong to me when i believed myself to be straight for 21 years and lived my life so happy that way. If either of you have lesbian friends what was their experience and did they hate it? I wonder when they knew as well? I'm so sorry for the long post but let me know your thoughts here - do i sound like classic hocd, bi mixed with hocd, or should i start reconsidering my whole life? I don't think i can ever come around to the idea of being gay because i would just reminiscence on my past attractions and my happiness. it would feel like I switched bodies almost.  I'm already so happy with my boyfriend but can't imagine how happy and thriving i would be without this - I hope in a year from now i can look back on this and laugh but i guess we can't be sure I appreciate all of you as well!",
      "Since you took the time to write a long post, I will answer a few of the questions: 2. Eros is not a light switch, it isn't on or off. A heterosexual person having homoerotic thoughts or fantasies is common, and visa-versa. Why? Because being heterosexual/homosexual or anything else is about much more than sex. It's about a commitment to that person in a real relationship and all is complexities. Even if you have sex with a woman but don't want a female partner, means you are NOT Gay or Bi. Your anxiety is forcing you to fear what is natural in human sexuality - that being, it is fluid. We are all different, you choose what you want to be by acting according to your desires. Not the desires you think might be hiding in a corner of your brain somewhere. The desires that are fully in your being. 3. Almost all of the gay friends I know knew they were gay by no later than 12 years old. Some as young as 9 - although they didn't think of it in terms of being gay back then. It was only in retrospect that they realized how they felt at that young age. 4. Someone who has been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (AD) can live anxiety free most of their life. But they have to accept and treat their disorder. It doesn't always mean meds.It doesn't always mean therapy. But it does mean living a good life (good sleep, eating, exercise, etc) and being aware that spikes can occur. To answer your question I have seen/read themes for people that have lasted a week or gone on for years. I have had a theme go on for years. You are not going to find the solution by fear-questioning or \"testing\". Let me talk to you from the future you (because I have had my OCD for 35+ year). This can go on the rest of your life. The theme doesn't matter because there are an endless amount of themes. I have had endless amounts of themes. It's all FEAR. Just fear, caused by anxiety. The face of your anxiety wears masks - HOCD, harm ocd, schizophrenia OCD, etc. The mask is not living, it is just a fake face. You have to learn how to lower your level of anxiety. The lower your anxiety, the less these kinds of themes will occur.",
      "“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” ― Frank Herbert, Dune"

      "Hi Snaga and every ocd sufferer, Long story short. I went on a holiday with my daughter. She has an invisible disability, she has MS and looks OK. Anyway, as we were walking along the tarmac, a worker was yelling\" move \" quite aggressively. We got on top of the stairs and about to go into the airport, we were off the tarmac and she was still yelling for us to \"move\". We made a complaint to another worker and the yelling tarmac worker was called up. She approached us with \" what's the problem?\" We said that she was rude and we were off the tarmac. And that my daughter has MS. She was snickering and smirking. And then I started to yell at her something along the lines of, \" how dare you be so rude. Don't judge. Just because my daughter looks fine doesn't mean she is fine, plus we were already off the tarmac. I also cussed alot. I continued to say, not my problem you have to work a crappy job for crappy pay. She never apologised so that made me furious, hence my yelling. She them said, you need something and motioned with her hand that I needed a drink to calm down. I told her to eff off. My daughter was crying and we walked off. She then says, you're going the wrong way and I said , i will go where I wanna go. We sat down and i consoled my daughter. After a few minutes we had to walk past the  horrible worker . My daughter was ahead of me and I was a few metres behind. I could see she was smirking and gossiping to the flight attendants. This is where my ocd comes in. One guy taped us so I'm embarrassed of that but I'm protective of my daughter. Then I thought that on the way back when we passed there that I may have clocked her one ( hit her). I don't trust my memory. I keep telling myself that I didn't touch her and that she didn't touch me. It was a verbal altercation. My daughter keeps telling me that I didn't hurt her and that eventhough my daughter was ahead of me, she knows I didn't hit anyone. I'm worried I blacked out and hit her. My daughter was only a few metres in front of me. I'm scared I'm in trouble. Ugh!! Why is it that people can have arguments and move on and the moment I ever have an argument, mind you I avoid confrontation , I think I've either hurt them or even killed them. It's been over a week. My heart races every morning. I even got angry with my daughter that she wasn't right by my side like as if her being a few metres in front has given me some time to hit the worker and walk back to my daughter. Please can someone help me. I know you have had harm ocd Snaga. I hope you can help me. Even having my daughter with me at the airport is no relief for my mind. Suz xx",
      "From what I have read, the issue you are having is being unable to shake off the idea that you have somehow hurt this person and can't remember. And then I briefly looked at your other post and noticed they had the same theme of \"forgetting something that could have dire repercussions\". First off, you are not alone in this \"memory loss\" idea. There is a specific theme and circumstance that plagues people who have anxiety disorders and are afraid something bad happened when performing a task. I won't go into specifics because I do not want you to adopt that theme but again, this is something that people with anxiety disorders suffer from - memory issues or blackouts that serve to create a 'what if\" obsession. To that point, you said in another post, that you suffer from severe OCD. I assume you have been diagnosed and are working with some sort of professional? If so I would suggest you talk to them about this specific issue, and discuss with them the situations you have been in that this issue has affected. Then you want to work on coping mechanisms. I have personally suffered all sorts of issues because of OCD. I have only visited this specific theme once. I was at a picnic all day and when I got home, I was afraid I had done something wrong (the details of which I won't of into). I knew I didn't do anything wrong but I was afraid that someone might have thought I did something wrong. I suffered for many days waiting for repercussions to occur. Naturally, it didn't. At some point, I just had to give to the thoughts that were plaguing me and get on with my life. Sadly, though, I never went to that annual picnic again. Not because I thought I would do something wrong but because I knew my brain would play the \"what if\" game and I would suffer for a few weeks. If this was a one-off I would tell you to just wait it out and do your best to get on with your life.  But it seems that your anxiety is going to pick and choose circumstances where the same fear occurs. That is why I suggest you get with a therapist and work on coping mechanisms and keep in communication with this person when you flare up. Otter.",
      "Hi Otter, Yes, I have been diagnosed with severe ocd. I take a hig dose of zoloft, 300mgs and seroquel 50mgs at night . I will be seeing.my psychologist next week. I just hope this flare up doesn't last one. I had a pond thought that lasted 5 years.",
      "If you had hit an airport employee, I'm sure you'd know it only too well.  The fact you were not taken into custody is proof sufficient, no matter how much your brain is screaming lies at you to the contrary.  I would suggest you try to not care at all whether you did or not.  The attitude of not caring helps me with my harm OCD.  I didn't do it, or I'm not going to do it, therefore I don't care .  OCD will just have to pound sand, I have to not care.",
      "Thanks Otter and Snaga. It's been three weeks and I still can't shake this thought. I'm almost delusional. I am starting to think that I hurt her. I know this is reassurance seeking but if I don't do it, I'm scared I will go to the cops to confess. So I tell myself this, 1) you are OK. You just had a verbal fight. You didn't hit her. There would've been a commotion. Security would've been called. You would've been arrested. Is my daughter not being with me the whole time at the airport enough?!! I keep thinking that I blacked out when my daughter was a few metres in front of me. So I somehow managed to go to the desk, hit the worker and then go back and follow my daughter out the airport. My psychologist has told me that I would've been arrested by now. That I shouldn't listen to the \" wolf in sheep's clothing\" ( the thoughts) and distract myself. But whatever I do, I am still scared I'm in trouble. I wish I never got pissed and yelled.",
      "I am sorry you continue to be at this elevated level of anxiety/panic. Everything your Psych said is true. Your fear is taking great leaps to create \"what if\" scenarios. \"What ifs\" are the backbone of this forum. Anxiety disorders (AD) of this type are like an emergency alarm going off in your head but there isn't an emergency. Whenever the brain is in panic mode, it must look for a reason. That's natural. People who smell smoke in their houses become anxious because something is really wrong. There is proof . For someone with AD, like OCD, no such proof is needed. And yet, their brain is still panicking. So a reason must be found. That's the beginning of all OCD \"themes\" (HOCD, POCD, Harm OCD), etc. Play through this. Don't give into the urge to investigate. If you had hit this person it would have been reported.",
      "My brain is telling me that I killed her. I'm waiting for the cops to come",
      "Hey. I'm sorry things have escalated. I have a feeling the cops will never come. You would have heard something on the news, or seen something about it online (if you tried looking). Here is a thought experiment. If you were to make a bet as to whether or not you killed the person you had an argument with, which way would you bet? You stand to WIN a million dollars, with the correct answer, or LOSE everything you own if you're wrong.",
      "Interesting bet, Otter.  Next time I 'hit' a pedestrian, I'll wager myself. NMT- dude.  Let it go.  At some point, you're going to have to let this the heck go.  When my brain tells me I hit a pedestrian (usually there is no pedestrian at all, so I am hitting invisible people) I have to fight like mad (and sometimes lose) the urge to go back and check.  But I have to remind myself that if I'd hit something as big as a human being I would know it .  If I have to think about whether I did, chances are good that I didn't.  If you killed this person, you'd KNOW IT.  Everyone around would know it, the cops would know it, they'd be sure you knew it."

      "Hello everyone, It's been three years on and off I've been living again with HOCD (after 8 years ocd-free), which however manifests itself in the form of obsessing over a specific person, usually a close friend or coworker. So the thought would go like \"if you're gonna think about him you're not gonna be able to have sexual intercouse with your girlfriend\" or \"well, if you think about him now you won't be able to enjoy this nice night out\" and so on. I proud myself of always being able to play this thoughts down but now they've become intrusive all day long and it's not about believing them or not (I don't), but rather that it's starting to affect my quality of life as it's omnipresent, as I feel like I'm having a filter put on which prevents me from enjoying life and being in the moment. It's almost as a short circuit in my brain. Now I have two questions: 1). Does anybody else here obsess over a single person? 2). I'm not seeking reassurance here, I'm more in search of recovery stories (possibly without SSRI); I read that exposure therapy works, but I'm wondering whether for a person with no compulsions whatsover and obsessing over a single person that would work too..? Any first hand experience with that? Thanks in advance for your inputs.",
      "I'm not sure if I understand what you are saying, so let me see if I am getting this right. You are a man who is dating a woman. But you are having intrusive (unwanted) sexual thoughts about a particular man, such as a close friend or co-worker? The intrusive thoughts are causing depression which ruins your night out or intimacies with your girlfriend. You know this is related to OCD, so you are not feeling what most people with HOCD do. Obsessing over a single person? You say, co-worker or friend, which means to me that this single person occasionally changes. Is that correct? I don't think I can answer the question without clarification of the above.",
      "Hello Otter, Yes, I developed an HOCD around 15 years ago. It then remitted after three years, replaced by SOCD for a while, followed by a relateively calm period of 8 years. This long hiatus made me understand that all of the content of my HOCD was nonsense, and that I'm very much heterosexual (with that 1% uncertainty that I have been advised to apply). Now, shortly after meeting my now girlfried almost 4 years ago, the HOCD returned in full force, also because I knew since the very first weeks that she's the one (we're actually getting merried in a while), which made it all the more worse. The thing is, my HOCD manifests itself in the fear of obsessing over a single person of my same sex: for instance, I obsessed about one of my best friends for a while (\"If I think about him I won't be able to have sex\"), then a coworker, and now over another close friend of mine, except this time around it's much more powerful and omnipresent, i.e. the intrusive thoughts about him are there 24/7. The trigger could indeed be the marriage, so the higher the prize, the more intense is the obsession. For me it's really the worst thing ever because it means not giving to my girlfriend that space in my head that she deserves, and basically having an unwanted presence in my brain when I'm with her, which makes me hate everything. For the first time ever I'm also experiencing feelings of depression because of this, which I never had before (only anxiety). So in this sense my HOCD is different because it focusses only on one person and it's not even fear about wanting to have sexual intercourse with that, it's more the desperation to have this person inside my head 24/7 (an intruder, basically). Now my question is: I really would like to avoid resorting to SSRI and use it only as a last resort. I've been reading everywhere that ERP should be the number 1 therapy in such cases, particularly the imaginative ERP. So my question to the public was: 1). Is anyone else here with HOCD obsess over a single person? 2). Does anyone here have positive feedback about imaginative ERP applied to this specific case? I know that it does work for HOCD in general, particularly the forms exhibiting a lot of compulsions, which I actually don't have at all. Thanks for your input.

      "Thank you for that detailed response. First let me say, congratulations on your engagement. Second, it was very encouraging to hear that your anxiety/OCD seemed to abate for an extended period of time. I have had shorter periods of relief but not 8 years. However, as I get older my anxiety is less and less and I have many tools to fight things with. It seems like you have a grasp of how HOCD affects you but you are still being bombarded with imagery, constantly and especially at times when it can interfere with pleasure, causing depression - though probably not clinical. This happened to me a lot. But that is the nature of anxiety when it is at high levels - we are afraid something is going to intrude and since it's our brain it intrudes right on schedule. A self-fulling prophecy. Let me try and answer some of your questions. This idea of it being \"one person\" that our anxiety focuses on,  yes, that has happened to me many times. But the \"person\" was really just a vessel for the negative thoughts. There was nothing in particular about them that made any difference. After a few days or a few years, it might leap to someone else. But the obsessive thoughts needed one person and so it picked one, usually someone who was in my life on a constant basis. So, not unusual. No SSRI? Ok. I am glad you still have it on the table as a last resort. I take a low dosage of Paxil and it does a world of good for me. But I am also BiPolar and Paxil in specific seems to be really receptive to positive change. But you seem like you are going to try to work this without. It can be done, so good luck on that score. I'm not sure how imaginative ERP would work here. It is not one of my tools. In the past, I had severe OCD and my Os were very complex, as were my Cs. I don't think \"thinking\" would have helped. Do you have a therapist? Have you discussed it with them? I would be interested to know how it worked for you if you'd like to share in the future. Otter.",
      "Yes, it's exactly how you say it, it's a \"carrier\", but it's still very painful not to be able to live in the moment with the person you most love. It's as if happiness was precluded. I wanted to avoid SSRI mainly because of their side effects. I'm also quite hypochondriac so I worry that those side effects would impact me very negatively. As for the imaginative ERP, let's say that my biggest fear right now is to live my whole life with this intruder in my head and merely be an observer of the most important things in my life like wedding, birth of kids etc. I think an imaginative ERP would unfold more or less like this: the last step of it would be to imagine that I'm 80 year old and writing a diary where I regret how poor my life has been because I had an outsider in my mind for the whole time. Then I'd have to record it and play it back to me for hundreds of times until I'm completely desentitized to this thought. Again, this would be the last of many intermediate steps to subside anxiety. This is how I imagine it. I haven't been able to find a specialist who would properly do imaginative ERP though. I'm doind therapy but it's more about acceptance and it's not very effective I must admit. From what I've read online, ERP and its imaginative subform are the only effective therapies (pharmalogical approaches aside) for OCD. Otter wrote: Thank you for that detailed response.

      "Hi, I recently got diagnosed with anxiety, depression, OCD and some attention related things (I don't think ADHD) but nothing else. I've started seeing my one therapist again (just began a regular schedule yesterday) and I go for neurofeedback. The neurofeedback did help in the beginning but things got worse. It began 2 days after going to one of my mom's friends house's. I began to get hit with these awful  powerful urges to hurt someone and they've just seemed to get much worse very fast. They don't feel like intrusive thoughts but very powerful urges. I'm very worried in a way I'm going to hurt someone. I think I have depersonalization too and that makes me feel numb which makes me more uncomfortable. I guess I'm not sure what I need here. My one doctor told me these thoughts should be DISconcerning, making them sound like it's actually pretty common. My other therapist told me that based off what she knows about me, I don't seem like that kind of person. Can anyone offer me any advice? Thanks.",
      "Moved from LWMI to OCD.  Which I would do, even if you didn't have an official diagnosis.  Based on the way you've described it. Harm OCD.  I've had it for over 40 years, and have managed not to murder anyone.  As far as OCD themes go, it's common as dirt.  Common as DIRT.  Rather mundane, even.  Nothing a therapist versed in OCD hasn't heard before, I'd bank money on that. So let me see.  Just to make sure of this.  You say they're not intrusive thoughts, but I think they are.  You have anxiety and depression, and you're worried that you'll hurt someone, right?  What do these urges say to you?  That you'll do it?  That you want to do it?  That you'll do it, and not know you did it?  That you'll lose control and do it?  That you're bound to do it, whether you want to or not?  That you'll black out and do it?  Do it in your sleep?  That you won't be able to help it? Who are the targets?  Folks you know?  Pets?  Family members? If that's an accurate description, well, been there, done that.  I was 10 or 11 when I developed this OCD theme, during a very stressful time in my life- my parents were fighting and breaking up, and I probably had a whole raft of anger issues and resentment and of course, fear- and not knowing about OCD, I seriously thought demons were trying to take over.  Heck, maybe they were- I believe in demons.  But still, no matter which, it's all BS.  If you were a killer, you'd be killing.  You haven't done it, so you're not it. I'd go long periods where I'd not have the thoughts.  Then I'd get them, hot and heavy.  I would do avoidance things like hide weapons and such.  For me, the worst was after I got in a relationship, then trying to go to sleep it would hit me- I'm gonna kill her.  In my sleep.  I'll just do it.  I want to do it.  I'll do it in my sleep and not even wake up.  And on and on. It's all crap.  I didn't start getting a handle on it, until I started to cop an attitude.  I had to stop caring about it.  I had to stop caring if I killed someone intentionally, or not.  I reminded myself that in all the years I've struggled on and off with such urges, that I'd not actually done anything.  So obviously, I have control over myself, no matter how much my brain screamed otherwise at me.  Okay, so I'm not going to do it, and my thoughts can't make me.  So I don't care.  Not only do I not care because I won't do that, I intentionally make the decision to not care, if I DO do it.  Not going to care.  Not a bit.  I'll worry about it, when I come to myself standing over a dead body.  Not before.  Until then, I simply don't care what I do, if I lose control. Now, obviously I do care, and I don't want to harm anyone.  But it's the attitude I'm talking about.  You have to have this attitude of 'I don't give a rat's ass'.  For me, that's what began to kill the ideas of harming others.  It was super hard to do at first- and it also involves not acting on any Compulsions to avoid the anxiety.  I had to break that Obsession -> Compulsion loop.  Anything that is or could be used as a weapon, stay right where they're at.  Get behind the wheel of that car and drive.  Don't avoid people I've had those thought about.  Act as if nothing's going on, because it really isn't.  Only as much, as I let it go on in my head.  And I decided I didn't want to play with those thoughts anymore, so I picked up my toys and left.  Informed my OCD that I didn't care, wasn't going to care, and I decided it couldn't make me care.  And it damn sure couldn't make me hurt anyone intentionally for no good reason, because if I hadn't killed a person or pet in decades of getting such thoughts on and off, then I'm not going to, now. Super hard to do at first, and it took practice.  As Yoda said to Luke- do, or do not.  There is no try.  It's just something you have to out-stubborn your brain with.  The first few times that I didn't act on any sort of compulsion to reduce the anxiety, it was super hard.  And I thought for sure, I'm going to lose control and harm them.  But hey, nothing bad happened.  And it began to get easier.  And easier.  Now, I rarely get thoughts of intentional harm, and when I do, it's pretty easy to dismiss them.  I just had to retrain my brain.  Oh, sure, if I let myself dwell on it for any length of time, I could slide back into that pattern.  So I remain firm.  I refuse to care, and in a few minutes I'll have forgotten I had that harm thought.  The moment I care about it, I've lost the battle. Anyway, if any of this resonates with you, know also that besides being a common problem for people with OCD, it's also usually, from what I've read, aimed at things or people you really care about, like family, pets, etc.  Also... and this one I have trouble wrapping my head around- it's my understanding everyone gets harm thoughts.  Everyone.  Like, if me and someone I care about and we're standing on a precipice, and suddenly the urge to shove them off it pops up.  Normies get those thoughts.  I've had non-OCD people tell me they do, and I've read shrinks say everyone gets them.  Normies simply think, 'what a strange thought' and let it go.  But not us, oh no, not us.  When you have OCD, you place so much importance on what goes on in your head.  What?  Why did I think that?  Do I want to do that?  I must want to do that!  I'm going to do that!  I want to do that, if I didn't I wouldn't have thought it!  And on and on.  And it sets up this feedback loop where you'll go through periods of just being convinced you're going to dissociate and hurt someone on purpose.  Now, as someone with OCD, I really can't understand thoughts like this being 'normal'.  But that's what I hear.  So if everyone gets them, I must not be the ticking time-bomb my brain would like me to think I am.",
      "Hi, thank you so much. I think this may really help me. Also, you said in the beginning you moved from LWMI to OCD. What is LWMI? Thanks.",
      "You posted to Living With Mental Illness.  Which is sort of a catch-all for things that can't be well categorised.  Seeing as this is a supposedly common OCD thing, and even better (for a moderator, but personally inconvenient for you having to suffer it) you have an OCD diagnosis, so into OCD it goes. I especially glom onto harm thoughts because I had to deal with them for so long.  Not that I don't show my OCD in other ways- I'm a very anxious person and it's kept at arm's length only by apathy and Lexapro. Un intentional harm, for example.    I still find it hard not to circle back in my car when I hit those imaginary pedestrians (or the occasional real pedestrian that was not hit, but I worry I accidentally did, anyway).  Such compulsions to 'check' that I didn't do a hit-and-run are strong.  I check heaters, power plugs, locks, incessantly.  However, one thing I did manage to get under control, were those idiotic urges/thoughts/worries of harming others intentionally.  They have no basis in reality, and I determined I was going to stop being scared of myself, or die trying.  Or would that be, 'go to prison trying'?  Since if they were real, I'd eventually have acted on them. Same thing with pedophile fears- as you've seen if you've looked at this forum's topics for 10 seconds, 'POCD' is rampant here.  I'll worry about it, when I've done it- not before.  I see pedophile themes as a variant of harm OCD, almost more than it being a sexual OCD theme.  The worry of being a monster.  The feeling that you will dissociate and just 'do it'.  The need for having 1,000 percent control over your every thought and action.  Which is impossible, which then just kicks your OCD into high gear because it's unachievable to have that much control over every firing neuron. With  those kinds of OCDs- things that are purely just 'in our heads' and not based on something external such as invisible pedestrians or my continual worries of screwing up at work- I have to make myself worry about it (killing, molesting) when I find out I've really done it, not before.  Well, even with the pedestrians- I have to make myself worry I've unknowingly committed a hit-and-run, when the police show up at my door, not before.  Otherwise you'll go mad with worry.  I call it 'deferring anxiety'.  It's not that I don't care if I hurt another, just that I defer that care for when it happens.  I defer the panic, the worry, the anxiety, the feeling like a monster, for when I actually have done something.  Anxiety about things that haven't happened is pointless.  I try to do that for my other anxieties- hypochondria, work, etc.  With varying results.  I'm most successful when it's something like intentional harm OCD, because it's so outrageous that I'd hurt people or things for no reason.  Or even more outrageous, that I'd dissociate and do something.  Which I have had some pretty good dissociation at times- and I very carefully steer my brain away from thinking about that, lest I give OCD a chance to bite into something solid and start my brain chewing on it.  I have to tell myself that dissociation or not, my core nature isn't going to let me just go out of control and start hurting anyone."

      "Made this account to ask this question. I can’t remember exactly how long I’ve had my intrusive thoughts, but it has been for a while, I’d say at least since I was around 9 or 10. And I’m 16 now. They’ve always been of a sexual nature, they used to be more sexually aggressive and rapey, but that’s seemed to drop away. I’ve always dealt with them well enough, but also I’ve now taken more notice to what  specific things trigger them. People, sometimes family, sometimes kids, and sometimes animals. And today it was really bothering me again about whether or not my intrusive thoughts were more than just intrusive thoughts. So I ended up looking at lolicon to see if it would result in an erection. And it did. Which freaked me out, My stomach was even hurting because of it. So I ended up masturbating to see if the disgust I was feeling would stick through the whole experience or if the erection would drop. It didn’t, and I ended up finishing. Normally these thoughts or feelings have never resulted in a physical arousal before, so that was the first time that happened, but I think the fact it was Lolicon specifically might be relevant? The arousal happened for that but never for any actual people. I googled into it and learned POCD can have a false arousal happen or something. And some of the symptoms sort of match with my deal, but like i said earlier, children aren’t the only trigger for the thoughts. So are my intrusive thoughts actually a part of A Sexual OCD or POCD?",
      "Hello and welcome. A few thoughts. Zellauss wrote: but also I’ve now taken more notice to what specific things trigger them. People, sometimes family, sometimes kids, and sometimes animals. Nothing surprising there.  Think of this also as overlapping between sexual intrusive thoughts, and harm intrusive thoughts, the latter of which most usually focuses on loved ones and pets.  This is literally common as dirt, from my understanding.  There's nothing unusual in this. Zellauss wrote: So I ended up looking at lolicon to see if it would result in an erection. Well, porn is porn, and don't forget that things perceived as Taboo can be rather invigorating.  Which doesn't mean a thing in the real world because people can think of all sorts of things that don't have any bearing on their real-world self. And, don't check.  Don't check, don't test.  You'll only let yourself down.  You're masturbating, it's not going to automatically switch things off because you're checking by looking at something you're using to test with.  Not to judge from virtually all the stories here.  Sex is sex, including sex a person has no intention nor real desire to engage in.  But here in this forum, we overthink these things.  Not a good idea."

      "Hello everyone, I live in England, the UK. I have OCD, depression, anxiety issues and autism. I am currently under a community mental health team in my local area. I'm not sure if this forum is a UK-based one or worldwide. But anyways, I need to tell someone as I can't tell anyone else about this until I get the proper help and support. I have told my psycholgist, but he's not always on stand by and only works on weekdays. I like cartoons and anime (basically they are the same thing. Anime is just a term for Japanese cartoons). I've always been into cartoons and animated things since I was a child. I enjoy participating in fandoms and reblogging/retweeting art and sometimes even posting my own art. I also have my own internet account where I saved images of NSFW art of cartoon/anime characters. I don't post other peoples' art on there and I don't post my art on there as I don't draw NSFW art. I don't want to write forever and ever, I'll cut straight to the chase. Some of these cartoon/anime characters are underage in the cartoon or anime. However, the NSFW art of them is them aged up to 18+. For example, Sonic the Hedgehog characters, Amy Rose the hedgehog is 12-years old in the games and in the cartoons/anime (I think). However a lot of people draw cartoon porn of her, but she's been aged up and doesn't look like a child. She looks like an adult. I saw a TikTok yesterday about how this man in the USA got arrested for having child porn and animated child porn on his device(s). As I said earlier I do save the NSFW/porn art on my internet account of cartoon/anime characters. I read online yesterday that apparently cartoon and manga images are illegal in England and Wales. I'm not sure about other parts of the UK. This has really spiked my OCD and I feel like I am a pedo and a sex offender. I feel like this isn't my OCD and instead it's me being a sex offender. I'm so scared that it means I'm a criminal and that I've broken the law! I don't download images of NSFW art. One part of me says it's just my OCD and that these cartoon/anime characters don't even look human. So I don't think any laws have been broken. But the other part of me says that it's in the law that manga and cartoon porn images are illegal. I'm not attracted to these characters and am only attracted to real people who are 21+. I'd never hurt anyone. I don't know what to do because I feel like I am a sex offender now. I've been trying to contact my psycholgist, but he's not replying to me.",
      "Well, what the law says, and what you really are, can be two quite different things.  If the content is dodgy from your country's point of view, then ditch the content and stop worrying, is my advice.  I personally don't think that stuff is anything other than fantasy, and you said it all with RainbowDrop wrote: I'm not attracted to these characters and am only attracted to real people who are 21+. I'd never hurt anyone. That's good enough for me, it needs to be good enough for you."

      "Since some hours I am ruminating about whether or not I have Zoophilia. I already had Harm OCD, still have POCD though I'm doing better but today I remembered things that make me panick really much. It's about animals and I'm terrified now. I'm a minor, female if that information is important. First of all, I want to clarify that I do doubt that I really have zoophilia. Just today I saw a dog and was like \"A DOG!\" because I adore dogs really much and would love to have pets. I never had any sexual feelings/desires towards animals, just some months ago I was hooked up on watching cute dog and cat videos and I melted all the time and it made me wish much more to have pets. Today, after I remembered it, I also tested myself where I imagined two animals doing it and I didn't get aroused (though now I constantly get thoughts that disgust me and I feel like I'm about to throw up). But still there are some things that make me doubt everything. First of all, since I was young I liked the book series Warrior Cats, and would also make an OC (like fantasies about me being a cat there). Some months ago I was really depressed and in a panicking state so having fantasies about being in this world calmed me down. I also fantasized that I would be together with one of the characters and it led me to wanting to fantasize about doing the thing with him. I'm not sure if I ever really got that far, but still I feel so disgusting for that and ashamed because why the heck would I imagine him and me doing the thing as cats?! I also once watched a yt video where two cats were mating and I think I kind of tried to use that as reference? Idk, I'm not sure about that but still I'm so disgusted of myself for that. The only possible explanation would be because I always have sexual fantasies out of the blue with older men, so I guess this also happened there but still it just disgusts me so much and that terrifies me about the possibility of being a z. Also, there are greek myths with animals and I tried to find two of them and that disgusts me too. I'm so panicking and terrified. Does any of that mean I'm a z? I don't want to have any paraphilia and I don't want to je the disgusting and ###$ up daughter at home. I feel so horrible, my parents don't deserve such a disgusting child like me and my friends don't deserve having me in their lives. Please, somebody help me",
      "Well, OCD is OCD.  It seems as if you've already had some OCD themes going on- tell me, have you been diagnosed with it?- and so this is a new one.  I don't think it's uncommon in these forums for folks to speak of cycling through various themes. You hardly seem to be a zoophile.  And also seem far from the disgusting person you fear being."

      "Basically what’s happened is I think of a thought with a girl and it’s good and then my brain goes I’m going to switch to a man and switches but then tells me it’s forced, what just happened is I was in the shower and I get a thought of a girl and I enjoy it and my brain goes ok I’m going to switch to a man and I say no and close my eyes to focus on the girl, pretty much a compulsion so that I can keep thinking of the girl and it doesn’t switch to a man, my heads telling me this is what pushing away thoughts and denial is and I have no idea. Like maybe the image was there for like 0.5 of a second with a man but idk my brains telling me I pushed away a thought and I’m scared. I just closed my eyes when my brain said it was going to switch to a man and focused on the girl to kinda stop it. Or maybe I was stopping ruminating or maybe I have actually forced it in the past in that particular way, and this time my brain started it by saying that, and I didn’t force it or idk. I know I’m straight deep down bc I only like girls I just need to know it wasn’t denial, I just don’t know if that’s what pushing away thoughts is and I need to talk to the pros here I’m still not diagnosed which scares me I had a slight obsession with animals, And I washed my hands literally every 10-20 minutes because I hated my hands smelling of anything and that I was gonna contaminate that smell, I used to think my glasses of water were made of pottery so I had to rub them into the right shape, I never really clicked that it was ocd tho but now I look back and those were definitely compulsive behaviours, thing is with the others I was uncomfortable the anxiety wasn’t really there it was just extreme obsession or maybe it was and I don’t remember I’m not sure, sorry for the long post",

      "So... For the past few months, I've been dealing with what is, apparently, pedophilia-themed obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lately, it feels like there might actually be attraction, though I can't tell many things apart. I can't tell if my disgust reactions are just consciously enforced or if they're genuine. I can't tell if my arousal is indicative of sexual attraction or otherwise. I feel evil, disgusting, and like I want to die if I am what I fear. Sometimes, I have moments of \"panic mode,\" I rage alone, cry to sleep, hate God, myself, and everybody else, and plan to starve to death. Other times, usually the day after, I test my arousal again and decide with clear certainty that I am not a pedophile, that thoughts of sex with ___ disgust me, and I don't want to do these compulsions anymore (oh, my compulsions are typically ruminating and self-testing to see if I'm aroused). I'm afraid that I'll never get to live a normal life. Before this theme, I wanted to be a dad, raise a daughter, a son, be a happy husband and father. Now, this is happening... On ######6 Christmas Eve! So, your two cents?",
      "Have you ever been diagnosed with OCD or some form of anxiety disorder? Have you had other themes? When you \"test\", what do you do to test? I am asking these things because your text is a bit convoluted and I am unsure what to make of it.",
      "Currently, I am undiagnosed. Yes, I've had other themes - notably, themes related to religion, contamination, and wondering if I am homosexual. Finally... Self-testing means I visualize ___ acts with ___ to see what my instinctive reaction is (whether it's genuine, societally enforced, disgust, or arousal). So... Yeah.",
      "Ok, so multiple themes, testing, and extreme anxiety mixed with symptoms of depression (it seems). I have had OCD for more than three decades. I have also been diagnosed with other things. The main evil of OCD is the holding pattern that it puts someone in. Ruminating starts and then you end up going in circles. Days pass, weeks, then months, and before you know it, years. All that time spent trying to \"figure things out\". Many people never seek help and just keep working the math. Only the equation doesn't make sense and there isn't a solution. If you want to be the family man you talked about, and realize your dreams - get help. I am on the other side of the hill you are on. I traveled the long way. Don't travel the long way. Good luck."

      "Hi, I am male 25 years old from norway, Ive been bothered by ocd around pedophilia and me maybe being one for almost 2 years now, It started with an ad campaign by the norwegian directorate of health for a website for people with sexual interest in children, I watch a lot of twitch and they targeted this ad to young men so I got this like 10 times a day for a week and was unnerved by it. anyways something snapped in me after like a week and I went googling what this campaign was all about and I was not assured, I shake my head and go to bed. anyways I wake up the next morning and this abstraction of a girl in her early teens being raped pops into my head and I have been unable to stop thinking about pedophilia since then, I think about it daily, I find myself being hyper aware of my groin around kids, and I also have a fear of seeing that ad again. What do.",
      "Hello Komplex - Question - beyond what you described in your post, have you any desire or have had any fantasies regarding young girls? Having things suddenly appear in your mind is common among those of us who suffer an irrational fear of something. It is a mode of sabotage. We are so fearful of something being true that our mind creates circumstances that confirm our worst fears. It is different than engaging in something that gives us pleasure. The same goes for intense groinal checks. There is nothing about your post that seems like anything but fear related to an obsession. Do you have a Psych or a therapist? Are you on meds?",
      "a few months prior to this beginning a friend of mine started randomly saying things vaguely insinuating I had an interest in young teenage girls and It really caught me off guard as I really didnt see where it came from. and then my brother moved back home with a young daughter after having lived abroad for many years and it was just akward being around him and then this ad came and I just felt uncomfortable being around kids in general as a result of this obsession right, didnt feel like my mind was pure so it was weird just being around kids. and just a lot of things that were weirdly timed. and then the statistics they pushed with this campaign of 3-6% of men are pedophiles didnt really help me either and this  ad was targeted against young men right and they went to describe how all pre-concieved ideas of a pedophile is wrong and so on. idk. Im just really tired with this $#%^ and I cant figure out how to twist my brain to make this nightmare end. Ive struggled with probably what was ocd before and Ive figured out to get a hold of it, but I cant this time. have I had an fantasies or desired towards young girls.. well this obsession has made me reflect back and there have been a few 2-3 things that really didnt give me any pleasure just disturbed me a little and I immidiately forgot about. Idk you would have had to have the most anal definition of pedophilia to label me as such prior to this obsession, but ive not really had any fantasies that gave me pleasure after this either, I have leaned into a few things while masturbating just to see if the obsessive thought would feel less dangerous, and then maybe it would go away. Im not seeing a psychiatrist or on meds. It just pops into my head like a minute after waking up and I feel like somethings off the entire day. and my p is the point of wanthobia of seeing that ading to move to a different country. so it may all seem silly but at the same its not a joke.",
      "KomplexKino wrote: I have leaned into a few things while masturbating just to see if the obsessive thought would feel less dangerous, and then maybe it would go away. If you mean 'checking' to see if thoughts arouse you, I'd strongly advise against that.  Checking while masturbating is not a good thing to do.  I think people fall into this trap that 'if I'm not a pedophile, then I will not be able to masturbate or orgasm'. Except that you're masturbating, and to a certain extent, sexual imagery is sexual imagery.  If you're stimulating yourself, a person can't guarantee that everything just shuts down if you think 'bad' thoughts.  Or are in awkward situations: a child bouncing on a person's lap is liable to create stimulation, and it won't matter how far that person is from being a pedophile, physical stimulation is physical stimulation- which means NOTHING.  But when a person checks, that gives OCD an opportunity to latch onto that as 'proof'.  Try not to 'check'.",
      "Hello, I am still suffering from this, considering talking to a therapist about this that I have gotten to talk to recently. hope this goes well. my brain is so drained and im so mad and tired of it all.",

      "Hello. I am a 23 year old male and although I am not formally diagnosed I am fairly certain I have OCD. I will cut right to the chase - me and another adult were having a conversation online about women we find sexually attractive. For whatever reason, out of all the women I've found attractive over the years, my first thought is this actress in this movie I haven't seen since I was probably 9 or 10 years old that I used to have a crush on. I bring her up on a whim. I ask him for confirmation - she was attractive in this movie, right? Before I continue I want to be very clear that I was not looking at an image of the actress at the time nor had I seen the movie or a picture of her in years. He replies with, \"Oh, I didn't know you liked girls like her.\" After he says this, I immediately remember that the actress was definitely underage, a young teenager.  I tell him the truth - no, I'm not attracted to her or girls like her, I just thought she was attractive at the time. But he pushes me on it, and tells me if I like girls like her, then I can tell him, he won't judge. I swear to god, I don't know why I said this. It was pure impulse and I can't justify it no matter how much I think, but I said \"I guess so.\" My heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest - why did I say yes to something I know wasn't true? We continue chatting for another 15 minutes or so before he leaves. My disgust with myself and with the conversation is overwhelming and I block the guy and delete my account on the messaging service. To make matters worse, I look up the actress I was thinking of and she was only 13 when she was in that movie!! Of course I don't find her sexually attractive now, why did I say that? I can't wrap my head around why I said or thought any of this. I have been thinking about this every day for weeks. I feel like I crossed a line here. Thoughts are one thing but I basically confirmed them with another person even though I didn't really mean what I said. My sexual attraction to everything is gone now and I feel like I am lying to myself no matter how much I check. I feel like I should be arrested for what I thought and said. I feel like I'm one of those freaks on To Catch a Predator that preys on children. How do I atone for this? Thank you for reading.",
      "So you were a 9/10 year old watching a movie with a 13 y.o girl and thinking she was attractive? Now that you are 23 you mention (off-hand) that she was an attractive female to someone you were having a conversation with. Is that right? First off, even if you were sexually attracted to her now that wouldn't make you a pedophile since that age-range is out of a pedophile's desires. Second, thinking someone in their teens is attractive is not the same as you wanting to have sex with an underage teenager. I feel like I'm one of those freaks on To Catch a Predator that preys on children. How do I atone for this? If you were one of these people you would not be posting here, looking for help with \"anxious thoughts\". You would be trolling online. The REAL problem is, you feel you have OCD. If you do, this situation will eventually clear up but it will be replaced by something else, such is the nature of anxiety disorders. If this is keeping you from living a normal life, I suggest you look for a therapist or talk to a Psych. Otter."

      "I have been suffering for POCD for a long time, and I thought I was doing better. But yesterday I remembered and then also realized something and it makes me so much more terrified that I might be a p. So some months ago, before I had POCD, I had random thoughts about watching rape scenes from movies/comics (all of those were legal). I even had a plan about where I could watch them and that I just would need to go on the site where it's streamed, but in the end, I never did it. Except by one; I was doing an edit of the show and remembered it and tried to search for it on youtube but luckily, didn't find anything. And I'm sure that if I would have really wanted to see it, I would have turned on the show. But I didn't do it by any of them. I think I forgot it right afterwards because I always kept my mind occupied with something else. But well now I remembered it and I'm disgusted of myself because in three of those scenes there were minors getting abused and I'm now terrified that it might mean I'm a p. Why did I even want to see those scenes?! I just wish my sister wouldn't have shown me those movies. I can't even sleep because of how awful I feel and the only thing that keeps me from having a breakdown is that in the end I never watched those scenes. But still am I considered a pedophile for that? I'm so scared",
      "watching rape scenes from movies/comics This is not an indication of pedophilia. because in three of those scenes there were minors getting abused Same as above. Your description is a bit confusing. I understand it's hard to talk about these things. I haven't seen your other posts but have you been diagnosed with OCD? If you are and you are testing, you should know that testing will make things worse. Try to ease up and not be so hard on yourself."

      "I’ve not been here in a while but something has been eating me up recently sooo I’m back This is extremely embarrassing but I’ve been fixating on and off on something that happened almost four years ago and recently I’ve been super anxious and it’s been taunting me more than usual. It was around Christmas and we had family to stay, I was home at my parents house from uni. I ended up sharing my bed with my younger cousin, she was maybe around eight on nine at this point? I am now 24(F) - was 20 at this point. Ok this is so so embarrassing but I tend to get very itchy ‘down there’ at night. I went to bed quite a while after her so I’m fairly sure she was already asleep. I was starting to drift off and got really itchy so scratched for a bit before I fell asleep. The next day I remembered this and started to feel uneasy worrying that it was inappropriate for me to do that when sharing a bed with my younger cousin. She complained about not sleeping well and said that I moved around a tonne in my sleep at that I kicked her (I do move around a bunch so this probably happened). I got really worried that she’d seen or heard me itching and maybe she thought I was masturbating or something (I wasn’t - I’m asexual and I have never masturbated - but if that was something I did I would obviously never do it in this context). I also remembered hearing about a controversy surrounding Lena Dunham about how she describes masturbating in bed next to her 10 y/o sister when when was 17 in one of her books, and a lot of people have accused her of sexual abuse. I know this isn’t what I was doing but it feels somehow like it was the same thing. I wonder if these people would have been just as disgusted if they knew what I did. The other half of this memory is that I have some vague idea that I momentarily held her hand while I was half asleep? But I think that might have just been a dream since that would be such a weird thing to do, but for some reason I just have this memory of it. Ive been running this in my mind on and off since it happened and it was literal years ago now. I don’t get why I didn’t just leave and go to the bathroom if I was that itchy or just ignore it. I mean seriously such a gross thing to do. And I’m so paranoid that I made her feel violated even though at the time I was fairly sure she was sleeping. Did I really do something awful here or am I being irrational? I’m having such a hard time with obsessive thoughts atm but I genuinely can’t tell if I really deserve it. Sorry if this is TMI, but if anyone has any insights at all I would so appreciate it.",
      "I hope it helped to discuss it. I don't think you did anything wrong. I also don't think that it was embarrassing. Masturbation affects the body in a way that goes beyond physical movement \"down there\". It is a mood and it affects respiration, and general people get more vocal. I don't think itching is anything that could be considered masturbating. I haven't seen your other posts but I assume you suffer OCD. It's not surprising that OCD has latched on to something like this. Did you notice any change in your relationship with your cousin in the subsequent years?"

      "Hi, I’m currently in treatment for my ocd. I’m in an IOP program that is 6-8 weeks and tomorrow will be day 9. I’m feeling better. The thoughts still come, but there is way less emotion attached to them. They fade out pretty much on their own. I was wondering if anyone has done an IOP program and what the result from it was. Not looking for reassurance, but this probably is a good sign. As you would suspect, the therapy is basically all ERP and it’s for 3 hours a day for five days a week. Getting out of bed was super hard say a month ago, and now I’ve got much more energy to actually do things. One thing I’ve gotten out of it is we all get weird thoughts, we just obsess about them. The content doesn’t matter because every theme is the same when it comes to ocd. Show ocd that you’re not scared. I had to drop out of nursing school last fall because my mental health was not in a good place. Now I can say that I would be able to do nursing school even though my ocd is still there (and I plan to in the Dall), but as mentioned above it has gotten better. I have depression and anxiety as well, but the Zoloft seems to be helping a lot. Thoughts are just thoughts. They don’t say anything about you or reflect your character. Still not where I want to be with this ocd, but I know I’ll get there. You are way stronger than OCD which isn’t even real.",

And that!  For our purposes, within the context of OCD, we are not our thoughts.  We have to be able to separate ourselves from every single thought that comes along, because they are not all representative of us."

It always screams at me that you want to be a woman, you have a vagina etc. I am very happy as a man and have never questioned my gender. Sometimes the thoughts even say I like them which isn’t true. Even the thoughts say I’m in denial. This is textbook ocd right?",
      "Hello and welcome. If the idea of being trans fills you with despair and you can't bear the thoughts of it, then that sounds like intrusive thoughts.  I'm bisexual.  I don't want to be, I wish I weren't.  Yet the idea of not being what I am is at the same time disheartening.  Because it's not an intrusive thought, it's not 'the worst thing in the world', it's not the end of 'me' to be bisexual.  It would be the end of 'me' to not be. These are what they call ego-dystonic.  People get thoughts that do not match their core being.  An OCD style intrusive thought is like, where we lose sight between thoughts that are merely thoughts, and things from our Id. In my opinion, if you were trans, you might not want to be trans, but at the same time, you'd find being male to be simple unbearable.  I'm male.  I'm male who happens to have a really strong feminine component to my personality.  I'd rather have been a girl.  But- and here's the difference- but being male isn't this unbearable thing.  It's merely a disappointment.  It sucks, but it's not as if I feel dead unless I'm female.  Bona-fide gender dysphoria, as far as I can tell, simply doesn't take such a casual attitude.  Ergo, not trans. I'm not sure we ever fully rid ourselves of OCD style intrusive thoughts, but with practice (stubbornness) it can be managed.  I have Harm OCD, and I had to make myself not act on any compulsions as a reaction to intrusive harm thoughts.  Instead of doing things to ensure I didn't you know, like kill anyone or anything, I had to learn to ignore them as if they weren't there.  After a while they lessen in frequency and in intensity- I still get them, but for the most part I shrug them off.  That's what normal folks do- they get all sorts of ego-dystonic thoughts, but they shove them aside and just think 'well that was weird'.  I don't do that- unless I make myself do it.  And that takes practice.  And it hasn't helped me with all my OCD behaviors- but you know, you take the wins you can get."

      "Hi everyone. Not sure where this belongs bc i'm not sure what my intrusive thoughts stem from. Ive experienced them for a very long time. Other people ive talked to have described thoughts like \"what if. Iswerved the car and crashed\" or \"what if i just jumped in front of a car right now but mine are worse. I'm too ashamed to tell abyone asode from my therapist. She says they're normal for what i've experienced in life (severe sexual abuse causing c-ptsd & i also have GAD, Depression, & autism) not sure which issue is naking me have these thoughts but its like okay sometimes as a kid i'd be in the kitchen making food and it would be like \"what if you just turned around, didn't notice your brother, and stabbed him\" or \" what if you like your cousin?\" I'd get so distressed by this i'm like no i don't but why am I thinking this? It makes me a bad person for even thinking these thoughts. I don't want them to be there. The worst ones i have are like \"what if you're just like your abusers, what if youre a p....\" which i know i'm not. Never felt anything like that. But when these thoughts take hold its like my brain is convinced my worst fears are true and i start being like \"omg what if i am and why would i even think that why are these thoughts crossing my mind. Nobodu else even goes there. This is messed up. You're a bad person\" but i don't wanna hurt anybody, far from it. I go out of my way to cater to everybody's needs and not make anybody mad. But my brain is like \"what if youre just trying to convince youreself you're not a bad person but you are?\" It's like i'm going around and around in circles and i hate it so much. Each day i'm convinced i'm a bad person for one thought or another but i can't control it and i don't wanna think these things and these are the worst things in the world to think. I can't tell anybody because i'm so ashamed. Its eating me up unside and i keep my distsnce from people because im terrified of them finding out and i know everyone would hate me if they knew. Is this something others experience or do i think these because i am bad? It makes me want to die and i can't handle it anymore.",

I tried to suggest it but i got dismissed and told it was just part of my PTSD. I keep trying to tell myself what you said, you know, if I was such a \"bad\" person, I wouldn't care so much about my thoughts. I try to dismiss them just let them pass, but I guess that's hard.",
      "It is not complicated, but it's hard to get started, learning to disregard intrusive thoughts.  I am successful with the more outrageous ones, mostly.  It's taking an attitude that you don't care if you're the thoughts, or they come true.  Like anything it takes practice, and you practice by doing it.  The more you do it, the easier it gets."

      "Hi. I suffer from severe OCD. I’m on meds and I’m in list for a therapy. I have a strange compulsion.  I lick my lips sexually and slowly, like I’m seducing someone. In order to see how this could be seen by others, I did this looking in glasses of parked cars. Now I’m afraid. What If there was a child in it? What if he/she saw me? I think he/she could feel scared, especially if he/she was 11-12 years and can understand sex. The possibility of hurting a minor is a nightmare for me. What do you think? P.s. I’m trying to not doing this compulsion now.",
      "Well, considering if you ever did it at a minor, it's completely inadvertent, don't you think in modern society, kids have seen more than that on their tablets and cell phones?  I'm in my fifties, and sometimes even I have to look up sex stuff I hear kids talking about to see what it is. Licking your lips?  I think this is anxiety talking.  Try not to worry about it, just like you said, be mindful of who might see you- after all, you wouldn't want someone that you wouldn't enjoy getting advances from, to get the wrong ideas about you."

      "Hello, I’m 22F and until I was about 19 I would occasionally watch and read loli. I never thought anything of it because I have never been attracted to children. I don’t think I ever even properly thought about what it actually was, until the last times because I would occasionally have intrusive thoughts about the police coming to get me and silly things like that. But for some reason I was just never bothered by the fact that I would consume these things. One day I googled what it actually was to have a definitive answer because I wasn’t sure if it was actually supposed to be cp, and turns out Google said it was drawings of underage girls. After that I stopped, for some reason I was still drawn to it for a while but I knew it was disgusting and wrong so I stopped and never really struggled at all with ever wanting to watch or read anything of that nature. I literally never thought about it until a year later when I was 20 and I was drinking at my girlfriends house with some friends and I suddenly got this thought that was like ‘that was cp’. I knew in my brain at that point that this wasn’t something I’d be able to shake because I know my brain very well. I’ve always had anxiety and mental health struggles and since that day I have thought about this every single day for nearly two years now. It has pretty much ruined my life. I’ve opened up to a couple of my friends and my girlfriend about this and they have always reassured me that there is nothing wrong with me and I haven’t done anything bad. I’m also in therapy for this and on sertraline and both have helped me cope but I am having a particularly bad day today and it’s hard to not drown in these horrible thoughts of just pretty much wanting to die and feeling unlovable and disgusting that I would ever do anything like this. Every day I’m surprised my friends are still around and my girlfriend who I’ve talked to about this in great detail still loves me. It feels like this massive secret and that if anyone was to find out my family would hate me and abandon me and my brain tells me that’s what I deserve. I have been looking on forums like quora today about loli and the people that seem to be saying that people who like this kind of stuff aren’t pedophiles are into loli themselves. I’m not into loli, it makes me feel disgusting when I come across it now and I would never dream of seeking it out again. But my groinal reactions and intrusive thoughts when I’m having a bad day convince me that I am attracted to children. Because it makes sense right? That’s what my anxiety tells me anyway. When I’m fully grounded and feeling good I know deep down that there is nothing wrong with me but this obsessive thought always comes back. One thing that made me feel better a few weeks ago was that pedophiles would watch loli to suppress urges to harm children, which I have never done or experienced urges to. But today I just feel very and and my brain always comes back to this when I’m feeling anything but good. I just want someone’s opinion. Thankyou for reading",
      "So I wrote this post and panicked then deleted my account and since then through reading about ocd I’ve realised the part of me consuming this when I was older could have been a false memory. I had a kind of eureka moment especially since realising I actually do have OCD. The reason being is that I cannot at all remember any of the content from when I was supposedly 19. I remember the few times I consumed it when I was a young teenager and didn’t know better but I do not recall any of it from the point where my anxiety comes from. In fact I actually remember actively avoiding it at that point, because I knew what it was actually supposed to be. Is it possible that all this mental turmoil I’ve faced from convincing myself I watched it when I knew they were supposed to be children was a false memory? Now I’ve kind of come to this conclusion this post causes me a crazy amount of anxiety because I don’t think it was even real?",
      "Welcome back to the forums! Well, OCD will do that to a person so that they up is down, down is up, and straight is sideways. If it's a false memory then try not to worry about it- it's false, end of story Not the first person to have thought and rethought themselves into something, and you won't be the last, I assure you.",

Hi thankyou for your reply! I just worry now that this post is up I could get into some kind of trouble and now my ocd has leaned away from this pocd business and leaned more into anxiety of being arrested or getting into trouble all because of one post on a forum it’s so silly, especially now I’m of the opinion it didn’t even happen I don’t even know if that kind of thing would be possible but ocd convinces me of wild things! I used to be convinced I was a p but now it has hyper fixated on this one post for months which sounds insane when I type it out. Convinced the police are going to knock on my door because of an anonymous post that I’ve realised was a false memory lol. Appreciate the response",

      "I posted this problem on a gay forum and they told me it’s OCD and I’m not gay or bi I keep testing myself by looking at trans porn like the bj scene where a man is giving the trans a bj and I get a weird sensation in my mouth and I can get to ejaculation very fast even though I would not have an erection and be flaccid I can make myself ejaculate by looking at this and having a sensation in my mouth? I’m not interested in trans people or have an attraction to them. My biggest fear with my hocd is the thoughts of giving a bj? So why does that make me get a weird mouth sensation and makes me ejaculate very fast even though I’m not turned on? I also get groinals from seeing a bj scene when I’m not masturbating also. Can someone help me please",
      "I wouldn't think trans porn would be a good way to test- all testing is bad and shouldn't be done, but given that a lot of men who look at trans porn are straight in practice, that's.. just not a good way to test yourself.  Since straight men do in fact look at 'tranny porn'.  I've heard various reasons why that's so but that's immaterial here, except that they do look at it.  I wouldn't check myself that way if I was battling HOCD. And wonder of wonders- a gay forum actually told you you're OCD and not tried to tell you you're gay?  That is gold.  Do not let that go, and take their word for it!  Usually I accuse gay forums of wrongly saying people ARE gay.  I'm Bisexual myself, so I'm not being anti-gay here, just stating an observation.",
      "I don’t like trans women or porn they don’t turn me on or anything I watch it as a test to see a bj scene to see if I can ejaculate to it and it worries me it happens quick even though I’m flaccid? I just want to know why that happens. -- Mon Nov 21, 2022 11:06 am -- I don’t like trans women or porn they don’t turn me on or anything I watch it as a test to see a bj scene to see if I can ejaculate to it and it worries me it happens quick even though I’m flaccid?

      "I don't know- because it's taboo, maybe?  I think they best rule of thumb, if you're not into something, don't watch it.  Yes, my OCD has in the past made quite a bit out of my bisexuality (meaning if I let it, it will bounce me between \"You're Gay, Gay Gay\" and \"This is all bull you're Straight\") but one thing I've never done is look at anything to 'check'.  I look at what I want to, when I want to, and if I'm looking at it, it's because I darn well want to.  Including trans porn.  If it don't appeal, don't look at it."

      "I need to talk to a therapist on this but I'm sure we all know how they dislike when someone has an idea of what's going on inside their mind. Maybe it's to prevent misdiagnosises. I as a teenager showered once in the morning and once at night and I brush my teeth until im sick and then i do it again. I didn't do anything \"dirty\" afterwards back then. No bathroom. No burps. No gas. No food after I brush. I have asked partners to shower and have washed them myself to make sure they were sterile. I randomly boil dishes, and I wash my hands twice sometimes. I refuse to sit on most toilets. I have washed someone's toilet when staying with them. I get sick from food I didn't prepare and refuse to eat at most parties. I got mad at my dad as a kid for spelling incorrectly on his grocery lists. I wanted antibacterial wipes as a kid. Really bad. I bleached my shoes a few times for no reason. Even when I know I have put something away correctly I check again a few times. If I close a lid and I'm pretty sure it's on right, I do it again two times. I obsessively make sure when I drive the mph gauge is perfectly the speed limit on the dot. My own body hair has to be shaven perfectly or I'm upset. I don't like eating or drinking after anyone ever. At all. I make sure to do the same routine every single day and if someone invites me out during this routine I decline. I refuse to sleep during the day. If I have a cut, scrape, burn, scratch I make sure to dress it morning and night strictly in my routine with peroxide, antibacterial, and a bandaid. I have to floss, then mouthwash, then brush. Strictly that order. Is this ocd?",
      "Hello and welcome. I mean, beyond being a germophobe, are these compulsions to allay some fear?  Such as checking a light switch over and over, for fear of a fire starting, that sort of thing.  We have obsessive fears, which drive us to do compulsions..."

      "I had POCD in 2013 and it was the scariest thing ever. Now i'm having intrusive thoughts again, somewhat weaker because of the medication i take for BPD. So i've been obsessing about a time i was 9 years old taking a bath, and my 4 year old cousin was on the door, looking and giggling. I told her to kiss it (didnt force it) even tho i didnt really had sexual urges. i think she almost complied but went away giggling. Another time i saw CP by accident when i was 13, even tho it digusted me the taboo triggered me and i masturbated to it. Now i'm back again suffering with a shitload of guilt over this, intrusive thoughts occupy my mind and the guilt makes me feel like a pedo even though i'm not really attracted to children, and never really thought of harming them or anything. In your guys opinion, how awful are those experiences, how bad should i feel, and how can i overcome the guilt?",
      "9 and 13. In the order you asked your questions- Not very, None at all, and judge yourself by real actions as an adult and not intrusive thoughts...",
      "after that i'd search for nudist pictures not for pre-pubescent children but for young teens my age (like 13 forwards) - that happened for a few weeks i guess - and once actually almost serched \"child porn\" to see that cause i really did not know how to word it(not actual pre-pubescent children), do you think that is too bad???? after 15 or so that never happened again - children actually irked me",

      "Hey all, So a quick brief description of my situation. When i first got hocd i was about 27 years old, ever since i was a kid i've always been attracted to women, when hocd first came about i was on holiday, i was approached by a gay bloke who made an awkward scene (alcohol involved), at the time this didn't phase me, but the next morning i woke up panicking that i had turned gay, for the next 6 months i showed all symptoms of hocd. Fast forward to my current situation, literally 4-5 years on, the anxiety weakened to the point of no panic, i could get on with my life as normal, however when i first developed hocd my attraction was fully there for the opposite sex, yet after 2 months roughly my attraction slowly diminished, fast forward to now and my attraction has never fully come back, my libido also went very flat, yet for very short periods of time sometimes they both come back and i almost feel completely normal, but then it disappears again. Also it's like i only notice good looking guys, it's almost feels like i want to look at them, yet again with little anxiety when this happens, the thoughts of sexual encounters with same sex doesn't disgust me, yet again i don't want to engage in them, i believe i've become so familiar with these thoughts that i'm just so used to them. I almost feel like i've been so engaged with these thoughts and feelings for so long that i sub-consciously think about them all the time, but yet where the anxiety has been gone for a while it makes me question why my libido and attraction hasn't come back completely? It almost feels like denial, but i can't get my head around it, having romantic relationships with the opposite sex from an early age, only ever fantasizing about girls, i just question how that one night can completely turn my life upside down. Has anyone else been through a similar situation? I would just like some advice on whether this still sounds like OCD and whether you can offer any advice to try get over the doubt of it being hocd. Thanks for reading."

      "Hi all! I've been going to therapy for my OCD and was officially diagnosed with it. I have Real Event OCD, POCD, Harm OCD, and a bunch of other subtypes. I've really liked my therapist and I think we are getting into issues that a lot of my problems have stemmed from. This is good, but also scary! I was wondering how you all deal with the wack-a-mole your brain seems to play when you start working on ERP treatment? For example, we started working on help for my Relationship OCD, and then my obsession switched to Harm OCD, and now I'm really struggling with POCD. I feel really tired and two sessions ago we stopped doing any ERP because I was feeling really sick and had thrown up from my anxiety. I'm happy I'm finally getting help and my anxiety does feel like it's going down / becoming bearable, but I feel mentally exhausted from changing obsessions so much. There's also a real event that happened but that I might be remembering incorrectly, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I feel scared to tell my therapist even though we made A LOT of progress and I've been honest about multiple things, but I feel like this one would be the last straw so to speak? I know it's ridiculous, but I'm scared. Anyway sorry for the ramble. Therapy has been helping overall and I'm happy I've been cutting down on compulsions, but still struggling mentally.",
      "Hello and welcome! Why do you feel as if this would be the 'last straw'?",
      "Thank you for the welcome and the reply! I think I feel that way because I've already talked about some mistakes I've made in the past already, so I have this feeling that at some point it'll become 'too much' I know it's silly to feel that way, there's not some set max limit of mistakes you can talk about or have, but for some reason I can't help but be worried it will be",
      "Update: just got out of my therapy session and told my therapist the real event I've been obsessing over and it went really well!",
      "I figured it would go well.  I figure there's not much a therapist hasn't either already heard, or heard of, or easily find other cases wherever therapists go to talk shop..."

      "Hello, everybody. I’m having a really difficult time right now and I don’t think I can handle the anxiety anymore. When I was 12-13 I had a severe porn addiction, but specifically to erotic stories, nothing with real people. Well a story I had read I was attracted to and had masturbate to, and I then closed out of the story and went on with my life. It should be noted I also did this thing where I would skip exposition and just go straight to the sex, often skipping paragraphs and just skimming because I didn’t want to actually read. I found the story years later and it turns out on the characters participating was a minor and two years younger than myself at the time. But I don’t remember the story involving a minor character, I just remember a woman and what I had thought was a man. I’m terrified now because I’m scared this means that I enjoyed it, but I don’t remember the story being with a child. I feel sick to my stomach. I’m not attracted to children, I don’t want to be attracted to children. I’m so scared for what this means about me and that it means I’m a pedophile. But I swear, I didn’t know. But at the same time I’m worried that I’m just covering it up in my head because I’m too scared to admit I knew? It doesn’t make sense and I think I didn’t intentionally do anything wrong but I’m just so sick all the time. I just want some advice and help since I know this situation is a little strange. I want to vomit 24/7. I would rather be dead than I pedophile. I think they’re abhorrent. Another thing that bothers me is that previously I had found stories that had involved children that made it aware of it immediately because of the tags and I was disgusted by them and refused to read or acknowledge them. I would read the comments of those stories and be disgusted by the people that had enjoyed it too. So now I’m scared that I’m like those people even tho I didn’t know it had involved a child. Am I a bad person?",
      "Another thing is that when I had discovered the story had involved a child, I had threw up and panicked. I couldn’t go to school. I was terrified that I didn’t know who I was anymore and that I was capable of terrible things. I don’t want to even hug my little brother anymore and I love him so much. Please, any advice would help. I’m so scared.",
      "I want to also say that the story didn’t have language that was descriptive of a child and I also didn’t fully read it. I just skimmed it.",
      "I think what happened is that I was focused on the woman more than the other partner. It had a tag that was pertaining to women and it was something that I had focused on for women and I think that’s why I didn’t notice that it involved a minor. But I’m still worried that I’m a bad person. I know I’m leaving a lot of comment I just realized that I left info out of my original post because I was so scared. Please if anyone has any advice it would help so much.",
      "Well, in the end, it's just a story.  You didn't read it for the minor.  Try to let this go, I don't think you're a bad person, not in the least.  Looking at it from the outside, if it were another person saying exactly what you've said, I'm pretty sure you'd think they weren't a bad person.",
      "Thank you for the reply. I know it may seem silly since I was a child myself, I just am freaking out. It’s the uncertainty on if I had purposefully done that when aware of it being a minor and now that I do know it’s like mixing with my current memory of it. What’s especially frustrating is that I had an episode two years ago with a similar incident where I was terrified I was aroused by a story that I had no recollection of being aroused by and was instead disgusted by, and it terrified me. But I had found the story I’m worrying about now, and immediately panicked because it was not how I remembered it. But I dismissed it because I hadn’t known it had involved a minor then, so it wasn’t my fault, and I had felt so much relief then before I started obsessing about something else. Plus I was either 12 or 13 so I have myself gracesince I had a tendency of not fully reading stories then, and also I was never attracted to stories that involved children and didn’t enjoy anything like that. POCD is the worse of my obsessions and it has me terrified every time I have an episode. Moral of it all, I know it’s just the uncertainty and the knowledge that I did do it that is causing me to spike and struggle. I think deep down I know I’m not a pedophile especially because it doesn’t make logical sense, but at the same time when I get like this all my logic just jumps out the window. I’m sorry for spamming my posts also, I was just struggling and I tend to get frantic when asking for reassurance."

      "Hello, I suffer under many kinds of OCD topics. I have OCD about sexuality, OCD about Harm, OCD about Religion or Magical thoughts, OCD about Relationship etc. etc. But since more than 3/4 year I struggle with aggressive Real Event OCD. My ACT and Exposition exercises working well with all kinds of \"Fear\" OCD, but I it goes about Failures and Guilt, nothings works well for me. I met many therapists with a lot of exercises but nothing can redeem me from my feeling of guilt. The story is that I made a big mistake in my past. I drank and drove - I know that was stupid, but I did this failure. Furthermore, on the way home a Hedgehog appears on the street, I drove right over him (middle), so the Hedgehog came not under the wheels. I walked back and tried to search for the Hedgehog but I couldn't find him. It's most likely that nothing happened to the hedgehog. After this experience, I lived my life for many years, got kids, etc. Suddenly I thought about the situation and felt very guilty because I couldn't be sure 100% that nothing happened to the hedgehog. I tried to analyze the situation and make OCD typical reinsurance of the situation, but I came to the point, that I will never know that nothing happened to the hedgehog because I couldn't find him. My feelings of guilt increased a lot. Since this time, I walk through life with a chronic feeling of guilt and nothing I try helps me to get out of this depressing mode. At the moment I am in a clinic and my therapist wants to work with me on exercises where I should consciously make mistakes. Unfortunately, I don't trust that these exercises will help me because my feeling about the situation will not change if I do a lot of other mistakes. I search for another point of view or an exercise that already helped other people with Real Event OCD. I want to discover more ways to recover. I have kids and a wife, and I could cry every minute because I am not able to live a normal life with them. Any ideas or techniques, especially from people with Real Event OCD are welcome. Thank you",
      "Hello and welcome! Well, it's a hedgehog.  Could have been a lot worse.  But it wasn't.  And it's not as if it were someone's pet hedgehog. Especially in this forum, I'm pretty confident none of us want to run over anything .  If I hit a armadillo or a possum, or worse, a raccoon (i'm fond of raccoons), I'm going to feel bad but it is what it is.  Critters cross the road.  Critters get hit.  Sometimes we just can't help it.  And you might have hit that hedgehog whether you were drinking and driving, or not.  Maybe I don't know how hedgehogs cross the road but in my neck of the woods possums and wild pigs and such well they just don't care they'll walk out in front of the headlights.  And armadillos are even worse: they'll get startled and jump straight up so there's not even trying to pass over in the middle.  It just is what it is.",
      "Thank you.  I think my problem is that I made a failure. My brain says to me \"you made a failure and a living thing may have lost his life\". I have no idea how I can handle these feelings of guilt while my brain tells me these messages."

      "So I just had an ocd moment.. my daughter had her head in my shoulder and all of a sudden I started to worry about groinal responses.. well of course I start kind of clenching myself to try and make sure I don’t get one and to stop it.Which doing that and worrying always makes me focus so much on it that I get one. at one point the weird feeling almost felt pleasant or tingly but it’s hard to describe! I can’t go down this rabbit hole of guilt again. Anyone relate?",
      "I used to use an industrial machine that could really have broken my hand, and in the moment my hand needed to move out of the way, in that instant before I moved it, the tension of the situation gave me, consistently, reproduced on demand, a not at all unpleasant sensation in my groin.  Kinda tingly.  Very similar to a sexual sensation. Nothing to do with sex. Not a thing. Just an anxiety spike. Experienced dozens of times, without fail. It was a fascinating experience and completely proved the theory of the groinal sensation."

      "So I start a new job today. Operating sophisticated equipment and I'm sure they ain't running a charity. Perform, or perish. I could have just as easily posted in general anxiety but I'll start here then do moderator voodoo later. I mean I do have OCD so yeah. If I let myself I can get really messed up over this. So many worries. I'm forgetful. Absent minded. ADD. Desperate. The list goes on. What ifs out the yin yang. Well, what ifs are just that. And I can't find out without getting out there. I just make peace with the idea of failure, which isn't the same thing as accepting it or giving up. Just make peace with it. With OCD we constantly put the cart before the horse. that has to end, for all of us. Somewhere, between being irresponsible and paranoid, there's a medium to aim for. Today I have to practice my own advice to defer worry. Too many times we are self defeating, I feel. I can do this. You can do this. We're more than our intrusive thoughts. If something bad happens, well, it does.  We can only take reasonable action to prevent our obsessive fears from being reality and then after that have some faith. In God, in yourself, in something, but have some faith. Ain't easy but seriously I don't want to be stuck in my OCD forever and neither do y'all."

      "Hi, I'm 30 years old and I have different types of OCD since 10 years. Now thoughts come to my mind about others having sex. These are usually stories or experiences my friends told when we sit in a group and discuss things. The issue is, these things are extra marital affairs or partners cheating. I don't want to think about that but I get these thoughts often. Also I feel aroused to the thoughts. And I feel bad. I'm single and I can't even masturbate because I think I am aroused by these illegal affairs. It's so distressing and I can't live normal. Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any suggestion? Thank you.",
      "Hello and welcome! Is it that you find yourself unable to think any other sexual thoughts?  What fear is there attached to these thoughts?  Do they make you afraid of something, such as being like that?",
      "It's not that I can not think any other sexual thoughts. Whenever I think anything about sex, these unwanted thoughts come to my mind. Then I feel it's bad to move on with sexual desire.",
      "You feel it's bad because you consider the behaviour you're thinking about to be immoral, then?  I can sympathise with that.  To an extent, however, thoughts are just thoughts, and for me I'd place fantasies about cheating partners to be pretty low on my list of things to be worried about.  Now, I could understand if you think that because you're fascinated with it, that it will cause you to be unfaithful in a future relationship.  That would definitely be the kind of thing someone with OCD would latch onto and obsessively worry over."

      "Hi guys I've been on desvenlafaxine for 12 days now and I'm feeling so much better of my ocd's symthoms, a lot of improve thanks God. However, I would really like to know about your experience with this drug as I know it's not very common its use for ocd. Thank you guys!",
      "I was not given the drug for ocd but for my anxiety. I started with Venlaflaxin but was switched because of side effects. Desvenlaflaxin is definitely helping my anxiety BUT I'm noticing a big change in things I was obsessed with. Especially gaming that was my escape from life. I find that I actually want to do other things or even find other things to do. This was unexpected but I will take it. I wish I had this drug 40 years ago."

      "I was looking at girls and getting the feeling I wanted to jerk off, so I went to, i read somewhere that stimulating the prostate can increase the intensity of the climax, so I tried stimulating it with my finger and I climaxed in like 10 seconds, but as soon as I started I got images of men penetrating me come into my mind, for some reason the anxiety wasnt there I just felt uncomfortable and tried to keep going and thinking of this scene with a girl I saw before, now my mind is telling me I loved masturbating with thoughts of men in my head when I enjoyed thinking of the girls, sex with men makes me anxious and uncomfortable and I don’t want it, am I just in denial because I finished so fast with the thoughts there. I just tried to ignore them. I can’t stop thinking about it.",

      "Hey, I believe I’m struggling with H-OCD and A few weeks ago I was having intrusive urges after I’d had a shower, these urges feel real but I felt so anxious and was having so many groinal responses, there was a voice in my head that said, “if a man walked in now and wanted to do it, I’d probably say yes just to try.” Which is completely wrong I would never want to do that and I felt so anxious not happy. My HOCD has latched onto this now and I feel sick with anxiety, I don’t want this, after this happened I went at it with myself to pictures of girls but my brain is telling me I didn’t and I did to men when I didnt, I’m not sure if this even happened. I hate this so much help. I’m doubting is this is even H-OCD, I’m not sure if this is a false memory of that voice because I’m not sure it happened but my brains telling me it did and that must mean I’m gay, when that voice didn’t feel like me and I was very anxious at the time. It’s latched into this and I can’t stop thinking about it and it’s making me sick with anxiety. I don’t want anything with men.",
