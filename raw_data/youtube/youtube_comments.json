    "text": "Since the video does not quite talk about how to recover from a burnout, I‚Äôll share with you my experience and how i am recovering :). I‚Äôm currently a student (teenager) and recently experienced a burnout. It was horrible (perhaps not as bad as yours, but it was nonetheless bad).\n\nMy story (its quite long but ill try to shorten it):\nInitially i was a relaxed student, i finish my homework last minute, and thats about it. (I did not do any extra studying) (i had, and still have 2 tuition classes but they arent really helping). Then i met some really studious friends and a teacher who inspired me to study harder so thats what i did. I searched up on ways to improve my life and when i got home each day i would spend more time studying. (I also did my homework in school so i could study at home). -> results at the end of the school year was pretty decent and i improved a lot. Then came to the next year and i was keeping up the good pace but then i was met with a number of disappointments and problems (studies, family fights, leadership roles, friendship problems). Thats when i started having a burnout. I stopped studying as hard and recently did horribly on my exams. I cried for no reason multiple times and sometimes still do. I would feel very lethargic and had more anxiety attacks. I was not panicked when i have not finished my homework- i didnt even bother doing last minute work. I told nobody about any of this even though i really wanted to (i have friends, close friends, and parents - preferably my mom, who i can confide in but i dont want to blow the situation up). Now comes the part when i realised i had a close friend (the studious friend) who was facing the exact same problem as me. It was comforting to know that i was not alone in this :) -> if you are reading this i hope you know you are not alone either. \n\nRecovery:\n- I took time to write out my feelings (especially when i feel down or have no one to talk to and that really helped because it feels like im being heard- it also helps me to sort out my feeling and identify the problem/ trigger) \n- I started to study with my friend instead of doing it all by myself (its comforting that she is going through the same thing as me but even if you cannot find anyone with the same issue, you could study online-> study with me videos) -> if you have an idol you like you could search up ‚Äòstudy with me‚Äô videos with your idols in it :)\n- Organise your timetable (it does not have to be very organised, just make sure it has enough breaks- short or long, for you to rejuvenate and feel better) \n- Its okay to cry (I personally use crying as a way to relieve my stress- im not sure if its a healthy thing to do, but it really works. I always either lock the room or go to the toilet for privacy but you can always confide in your ‚Äòcrying buddy‚Äô if you need to. Do what‚Äôs suitable for yourself.) \n- Optional, but you can take up meditation. It personally really helps me to gather my thoughts and calm myself down. (I also have an offline playlist that plays anxiety-calming music just incase i have an attack when im outdoors)\n- Dont take up too much at once. (Always space out your events/ classes and only take what you can handle. There‚Äôs no point taking up so many projects/ responsibilities and not being able to keep up in the end.) \n- Find someone you can confide in. I know it might be hard- especially if you have trust issues/ social anxiety/ is an introvert but it can be anyone. Your family/ close friends/ online friends -> just please make sure they at least trusted. Its much easier sharing the burden than carrying it all by yourself.\n- Take time to heal. Find a hobby you enjoy or perhaps go on a vacation/ walk in the park. Whatever works for you. -> try to do that at least once or twice everyweek. Try to time yourself so you dont end up eating into work time. I learnt that studying/working for 30minutes and taking a 5minutes break is really helpful (during the 5min break try not to use your phone because that‚Äôll drive you off-course). \n\nI hope at least one of the tips here helped you- if you even read this haha :) have a good day. Remember, you are not alone in this. If you need someone to talk to you but theres no one around you, can talk to me (reply on the comments :)) stay safe buddy",

I worry that my body will just kill me before I can recover. I was that person giving it 150%, dedicated, and driven. It's like trying to pick myself up and trying to walk, but both my legs are broken. I worry that I am days from giving up. I am exhausted. I have no income because I left my job, but I am too ill to get myself back on my feet. I moved back home, to Canada, and found that there is no help, there is no financial assistance, and the programs the psychiatrist suggested were shut down. I was diagnosed with PTSD. What do I do? I suppose my only option would be to sue the employer that got me to this stage because they allowed years-long harassment to occur, they caused me incredible levels of stress through incompetence (expertise and equipment I was supposed to have access to didn't exist, they caused several disasters I had to sort out, etc.). Unfortunately, I have no funds to do that, justice is only for people with means. What do I do?",

    "text": "I argue how important it is that we heal the epidemic of burn out syndrome in America as it is one of the most crippling disorders a person can have and is affecting our societies and communities in a devastating way. The primary reason why it is important to heal burn out among societal members is that there will be less isolation, abuse of addictions and substances, acts of aggression, and social withdrawal and isolation among citizens. Often these causations lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms of many Americans individually but on a larger scale lead to the breakdown of societies. When individuals heal from such mental disorders they are able to be more intune with other people‚Äôs needs, be more compassionate, and be leaders, this is essential for physicians working in the health care system. It is especially important that doctors find treatment for burn out syndrome because the longer depressive symptoms go untreated the higher likelihood of the depression returning and hitting the person in a more severe and harmful way. Secondly, it is important to heal burnout syndrome because healing means more improvement in a person‚Äôs personal and professional life. When a person heals from burnout syndrome they develop a more close knit relationship with their needs, are more resilient, and feel more accomplished like they have a purpose in their life. As doctors are oftentimes working with sad cases, it is essential that at least their personal and professional lives are working smoothly to cope with the compassion fatigue that so often healthcare professionals have. Healing this condition would cultivate a deeper knowledge and understanding of themselves and a kinder look on their own limitations. This is essential as most doctors have perfectionistic personality types and are constantly beating themselves up unnecessarily making their job miserable and increasing their burn out symptoms. Thirdly, as burn out increases the effectiveness, their ability to stay engaged, their morale, and overall quality of work goes down. Although the effects of burnout are not numerically counted in the healthcare field, the emotional toll and the quality of work  is definitely felt amongst their patients. When this is gone unchecked and untreated, the body manifests it through often unexplained physical ailments such as constant fatigue, aches, pains, sleep changes, and other long term health issues such as heart disease or cancer. I believe that we future  doctors and physicians are so needed and the importance of healing burn out syndrome, which often goes unnoticed, is essential and cannot be understated. May we protect ourselves and other doctors that we work amongst and bring this syndrome out in the open, acknowledge it within ourselves, and find healing and hope.",

    "text": "‚ÄòYou start to avoid activities that promote recall of the event or stressor‚Äô <-- this is so true for people who feel burned-out from work. Not only does this statement really resonated with me, but I think it also shows how burnout and PTSD both cause similar symptoms. I also agree that people who get burned-out at work are those who naturally are considered high-level performers, cause it takes a fire to leave you in a state of ashes. If you get burned-out from work, then you can no longer be the achiever that you once were, cause you want to avoid the 'tramatic and stressful experience.'\r\n\r\nI feel like I got burnout after experiencing a stressful experience working on two projects with a total of 4 different supervisors and 1 new worker. The 1 new worker basically had no business being in the business with his poor capabilities, constantly making mistakes that I had to fix. He also had an EQ that resembled one of a child, so he could not understand when I would really get sick and tired of his work quality. One of the four supervisors was a slimeball of a human who took credit of my work while another did not push the project forward at all at her end while constantly making broken promises that she would. Another supervisor, whom I started out respecting, had disagreements with me on the project's direction, where he would just not listen to my input. As a result, I had to work on a project that I believed was moving along a wrong route. (He eventually agreed with me on 1 of the 2 issues I had upon talking to an outside consultant, proving that I was right for at least half of what I said). \r\n\r\nI hope I can go back to my old self. Not to make this a long essay, but my recommendations for anyone feeling burnout would be as follows: [1.] Get your sleeping cycle in order. This means going to bed early and having a full 7 to 8 hours of sound sleep. Trust me, you will feel refreshed when you wake up. [2.] Prioritize. Do things first which needs your attention the most. [3.] Do not multitask. Our brains aren't designed to multitask, so stop doing it already and focus your attention on one work at one time. You'll perform much better this way. [4.] Be a little conscientious. Try to keep your room tidy and things arranged properly. [5.] Have a list of daily achievable goals and try to get those completed on the same day. [6.] Keep away from social media as much as you can. Social media is like junk food for your brain. [7.] Be thankful for what you have. If you are reading this, trust me you are truly lucky and have much more resources at your disposal than at least half of the world's population. Last, I must say, however, I do not wish to agree with the great speaker's 2-year recovery period generalization or story of getting cancer. These need not apply to everyone.",

I basically came all this way with practically zero medical support.  Psychiatrists throw anti-depressants at me and no one wanted to recognise the PTSD aspect to this.  The ADHD aspect has also been ignored.  I ended up with rheumatoid arthritis after 4 years.  I am finally in a place to heal.  I got disability... Not for anything I can point a finger at but rather due to severe short term memory problems.  You are the first person to put this all together and even though I am finally healing, it's gratifying to know that I was right and all the Drs were wrong üòÅ Thank you üôè",

I started to feel burnout at the end of last year, with boring project and absence of opportunities in my career, isolation due to pandemics, and 2 kids having corona at the same time, and buying a new apartment with all legal procedures related to it... I hoped that I will have time to deal with it after New Year, but then the rumors about the war and russian soldiers on the borders of my country started to spread... And 24 of February - the full-scale invasion of my country, my city was bombed daily, stress was unimaginable... I fleed to Germany with my kids, took a second job to support my family and my country. And now I don't know what to do - I can't motivate myself to do anything, sometimes it's hard to just take a shower, I want nothing. I scream at my kids, and they are 1 and 4 years old. I quit 1 job, but I can't normally deal even with one that left - my performance did downgrade to like 10% from what I had before... It drives me crazy that I don't know what I want, that I feel nothing but exhaustion and frustration, and I'm ashamed of that... Now I get that I'm not the only one with such problem, so maybe with time I'll recover from it",

A CEO who deliberately breaks someone's leg is prosecuted, but for inflicting psychological damage they go unpunished. This video, like many others, sums it all up nicely.

I'm not sure how it showed up on my feed, but for 6 years (2007-2013) I dealt with one medical emergency after another in my family and took care of my mom as she had ovarian cancer.  After that I had a cancer scare (2016) and surgery that left me with a paralyzed vocal cord.  And alongside it all, for the last 9 years (2013-2022) I have been working on major projects under intense deadlines and with excessive overtime (like 50%+), with little reward.  A couple of years ago I made a plan to move to a mountain town.  I currently live in a small apartment and live quite frugally overall to make that dream a reality.  We know what real estate has done these last two years, so as a single person I feel I need work twice as hard to make it all happen.  For several years my cortisol levels have been sky-high (never coming down in any of the testing I've had done), and created autoimmune issues.  And yet, here I am, continuing to work so I can take care of myself when I'm older (I'm in my 40s now).  And with Covid an overseas vacation has been put off for the third year in a row.  Is this burnout?  Does it take longer to get through it the longer you've experienced it?",

I just personally have one objection. Self care isn't having baths and buying fancy things. Self care is exactly what you did in this situation. Caring for your needs while in burnout. Taking time out, showing compassion and love to yourself and allowing yourself to recover. Purging your emotions and getting support is self care. That's true self care. Just because other helped, it doesn't mean it's not self care. You took some time to care for yourself in any way that was helpful to you. The reason we call it self care, is because a main reason for burnout, is giving too much to others and not enough to cover your needs.",

    "text": "My wife said that this is wrong about caring and loving for someone with burnout. I'm the one with burnout. I thought this video would help her to understand but it didn't unfortunately. I feel I struggle alone when I hit burnout. Oh well...life can be like that so I try to be kind and gentle to myself as well as I can be. I appreciate your efforts and awareness on this video and in no way I am putting my wife down. Not everyone is going to understand this as some people think just push yourself but burnout is beyond that. I explained to my wife and I think she struggled to comprehend it so not everyone is going to understand unless they have burnout themselves. She sees that when I'm burnout I'm depressed, dysregulated and she's scared of me even though all I want is a warm loving hug. I can understand how she feels though because I used to drink to cope and my behaviour wasn't the best. I've stopped drinking a while now but I think that fear is still there. I guess it's something that we both need to work on and I know it's going to take time but it's me who wants to work on this more rather than my wife as it's really my issue with the burnout and wanting that love where I'll be in bed all day and I won't be checked on once whilst she's happily watching Netflix all day. When you are so burned out it's zero energy even to ask for a hug unfortunately and this is the sad thing. She says she's not a mind reader knowing when I want a hug and I should go to her but when my batteries are completely gone there is no energy to go to her or send a message or call. I can't do absolutely nothing and struggle for hours. Any advice? I know that this is a tricky one.",

It's destroyed my life and everything I wanted to do with it.  I repeatedly tried telling girlfriends, friends and family I needed support, I needed to feel cared for, to feel loved, etc.  Instead, they told me they don't care and I needed to deal with it myself.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think I'm the odd one out; I'm guessing there are far too many people like me needing support, needing to feel valued, respected, loved and appreciated that don't.\nSo what do we do when we need support and cannot have it?  I love what you say that there is probably someone on the other side of the looking glass wanting the same thing, but some of us literally don't have those people.  I think many of us are alone these days, whether physically, emotionally or both.   What then?  When there literally is no one in our lives but ourselves?  When everyone we confided in pushed us away rather than welcoming us in?  Where do go from here??",

As far as work, I have been to the point of fantasizing about quitting and zero concern about the consequences.

Unfortunately, when someone has an inherited condition like I do (hEDS) stress can certainly make it worse, but the lack of stress in my life will never cure me of health problems. So it can be a very damaging perspective for someone like me who practices Buddhism and takes mindfulness and stress into account, but still lives with some pretty severe health complications. My whole life has been doctors oversimplifying my health issues to just stress until I was referred to a geneticist. I inherited my EDS from my dad. Completely different health issue, but in 1988 my mom was told numerous times her gastro issues were the result of stress and in fact she had pancreatic cancer. Her cancer was removed with something called Whipple surgery which was fairly new at the time, and the local newspaper did a story on my mom about how it‚Äôs important to listen to your body and get other opinions. So, I‚Äôm just putting this out there, but some issues really are just medical problems.",

    "text": "The way Angelo shared his journey with depression is a powerful reminder of the importance the need of open conversations around mental health, especially in breaking the cycle of keeping it to oneself that prevents people from helping us.\r\n\r\nWhat hit me hard was when you described feeling isolated despite having fun with your friends or family. No one notices it because we can hide it with a smile just like Angelo did because we think that If we ask for help from them we‚Äôre afraid that they will invalidate us, and it‚Äôs good to see how you found strength through family and professional help.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôd like to add the importance of taking simple steps toward healing, just like you said in your story. It‚Äôs okay to progress slowly rather than having no progress at all. What matters is that you fight it and never give up.\r\n\r\nFor those who are watching, If you‚Äôre experiencing the same thing Angelo did, don‚Äôt be afraid to seek help from your friends and family. It‚Äôs not a weakness to seek help but it‚Äôs the strongest thing you can do. Another thing that can save you ‚ÄúHelp is Available Line‚Äù (Call 0966-351-4518 in the PH), offering 24/7 support.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm thankful that I found this video, contents like this remind us that we‚Äôre not alone and that seeking help is the key to defeat depression.",

    "text": "Experiencing depression is like a room filled with dark emptiness; it is scary and lonely. And finding the door to get outside the room is very difficult and sometimes, painful. Angelo's story reminds us adults, teens, and kids that we all have our own battles in life. And, we are not alone. Approximately 280 million people in the world have depression, and you might be one of them. Like Angelo, I am also struggling lately with my life as a college student. Thinking about everything makes me want to give up, especially since I don't have anyone to talk to. Life has been difficult lately as an 18-year-old kid who is still figuring things out. There are times when I wish that I could forever be a kid who never gives a damn about anything. With my friends, I show no weakness. But I realize it is a defense mechanism to hide my problems, which I do not want to share. College life hits me hard. I face academic failures and disappointment, and I question my abilities. It's draining. It's like living in brittle glass. There are so many pressures and expectations from my family and friends. But, seeing it in a good light, those kept me going. They fueled my desire to prove myself and grow. And this video motivated me to seek help when in need because we can't beat this thing alone. That's okay; there's no shame in that. We can also beat this stigma. We must show others that it's normal to seek help, no matter how strong you think you are. I know it is not easy. Even Angelo and I are having difficulty with these types of things since I'm used to not depending on others. But to you who are reading this: Don't ever give up on yourself. I have faith in you. I wish you good luck in your silent battles. You can do it. And if you ever feel nobody loves you, always pray to God. He is the light in the darkest room of your life.",

Lekin yaad rakho, andheron ke baad roshni zaroor aati hai.\n\nJab insan takleef aur tanhai me hota hai, to uska dil kisi aise sahare ki talash karta hai jo hamesha uske sath rahe. Shayad tumne bhi isi talash me khuda ko dhoondha hoga, par jab jawab na mila, to bechaini aur barh gayi.\n\nSachai ye hai ke khuda hamare bohot qareeb hai, lekin hum usko unhi asoolon ke zariye dhoondhte hain jo hamari soch me bas gaye hote hain. Allah se milne ka rasta humari umeed aur yaqeen ke zariye guzarta hai.\n\nAllah ne Quran me farmaya:\n\"Aur jab mere bande tum se mere mutaliq sawal karein, to (keh do) main unke qareeb hoon. Jab bhi koi mujhe pukarta hai, main uski pukar sunta hoon.\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:186)\n\nZindagi me sab kuch hamare bas me nahi hota. Kabhi kabhi hum itne toot jaate hain ke khud ko sambhalna bhi mushkil ho jata hai. Lekin Allah wahi hai jo tuti hui cheezon ko bhi jod deta hai. Uski rehmat itni wasi hai ke wo hamesha apne bande ko apni taraf palatne ka mauqa deta hai.\n\nSochiye, agar sab kuch hamare control me hota, to kya hum kabhi apni kamzori ko samajhte? Shayad nahi. Yehi pareshaniyan humein yeh yaad dilati hain ke humari taqat aur madad Allah hi se aati hai.\n\nAgar dil bechain hai, to Allah se baat karo. Apne dard ko uske samne rakh do. Wo bepanah mohabbat karne wala hai. Shayad ab tak humne Allah ko un expectations se dekha jo dusron ne humare dimaag me bhar di thi. Is baar apne dil se pukaro aur dekho wo kaise jawab deta hai.\n\nAllah tumhein sukoon aur hidayat de. Ameen.\n. Tum akele nahi",

Trauma causes structural disruptions in the brain. We were wired for love and fellowship. It's woven into the fabric of our dna.When we don't get that and we've been abused our whole life's and we have absolutely no friends or family. You have no connections or bonds on a deep level with anyone and every time you try you get hurt then you are gonna be depressed. Then when you get depressed and you can't take the pain and loneliness anymore you start to lose it. People act like me going to a doctor and getting pills shoved down my throat is going to make me feel better. It never does. Holidays are the worst. If I can make it through another holiday alone then I still have some life left in me. Even seeing a counselor doesn't help. You can still choose to move forward and thrive but it doesn't take the pain away of not being loved or having anyone to spend time with.",

Therefore, we should have faith in Him, His power, and His love for us.¬†I¬†encourage you to go to God in prayer.¬†take this time to pursue God.¬†For and foremost ask God to protect, comfort, guide and strength you through this trial. It will only weigh on your mind more and more and¬†potentially miss out on the spiritual benefits of seeking guidance and comfort,¬†if you neglect to pray before the Lord.¬†We are to give our grievances, our emotional turmoil, our anguish ‚Äì to God.¬†Our peace is not determined by our circumstances.¬†Our peace is dependent upon our relationship with God. The closer that we are to God the more peaceful we are.¬†practicing discipline with your mental state to surrender your issues to Jesus Christ is something God desperately wants from you.¬†do not lean on your own understanding but just trust in Jesus Christ,¬†He is the only answer to all your problems. He knows you completely and knows your pain too and He will heal your heart and¬†will pour His blessings upon you.¬†Now, it's up to you to repent and put your trust in Jesus. Let Him lead you.¬†Strive towards being satisfied with God, because if He can't satisfy you, how can any person?\nJesus said in Matthew 11:28, ‚ÄúCome to Me, all¬†you¬†who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\nPhilippians 4:6-7 states, ‚ÄúBe anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;¬†and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.",

I can relate to the first 5 'should's , especially \"I should be married by now\" and \"I should be further along in my career\", which looking at it objectively, I really should, and I'm close to 60. The reason I haven't realised my 'shoulds' is because of my major depression, which I've had to deal with over the last at least 45 years, and sadly, am having to exist with. My 'career' is all but dead now, having been made redundant 6 years ago, and my depression just destroying everything in its path. I've never married, nor have I  (which you might expect if I had been), been divorced, so as far as I can see, I'm potentially where I'd have been if I were married and divorced - alone, but still having my house.",

    "text": "OK.  We have Todd Grande who is actually super cool, because he's a THERAPIST ASSHOLE.  Todd sort of implies, you can find a lot of people possibly doing something wrong, let something terrible happen in the name of motivation.. People are sweeping something under the rug due to something to do with people still appearing motivated.  We have that for sure, stop the show and reorganize, but oh no, they're not gonna.. and you find smart people still doing this.  We're into the forensics?  Here's a good one then, the should.  Can you find someone acting against their own best interest for a should?  Hell yeah, and that's a lot to do with it.  So what is it about, Todd I think is implying something about punishment, does it work and who does it work for.  When I was working on my MRI degree, the professor Dr. Weening is privy to lawsuits against MRI facilities, and what does he say.. It's often about broken equipment, something is broken but they decided to soldier along anyway (my experience with this is true, somehow a broken \"coil\" the part you put against the body to read in the magnetic information, can get ridiculously hot, and if you hold it just the right way it might still work, like a lot of electronics.. your phone cord doesn't seem to work unless you hold it at 43 degrees and upside down.  Burns.. but the techs didn't flag the broken part.  Whole lot of should here yeah.  It's forensics, do we have people shoulding to a extent of some kind of serious negligence, and what would be the recommendation to do about it",

I've tried to introduce it to my children as they were growing and continue with my grands. \"Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy\" is what he called it. Sadly, the more indoctrination we have to irrational programming the harder it is to \"Challenge and Dispute\" it. It is amazing to me how screwed up our \"belief systems\" become. \"Should, Ought, Must, Got To, Have To, Need To, I Can't Stand It\" just to name a few. I shudder to think where I would be had I remained in that nightmare. Life is much less complicated than our irrational thinking can make it. Living without rage was worth my effort.",

    "text": "I understand the sentiment behind this but frankly I found so many logical problems with this mentality over the years to the point where when someone starts telling me things like this I just shut them down immediately because I'm tired of hearing the cliche. For a brief clarification, saying that I can't compare myself to other people whether they are higher on the ladder or lower on the ladder is actually very damaging to any sort of objective analysis. If you want to become a master furniture maker you're going to have to compare your work towards someone who already is a master furniture maker. Even more so if that person is literally teaching you how to do it. If you know people who have the type of success that you want to have, you have to compare yourself to them otherwise how are you supposed to know when you are achieving similar results. Yes you can do it too much and it becomes a toxic exchange but it doesn't necessarily have to be that way. Making a blanket statement that comparison is always negative is extremely short-sighted and one-dimensional. people tell me that I don't have it so bad because there's other people that have it worse than me, no one seems to have a problem pushing that type of one-sided comparison. Seems a bit hypocritical to me. Even more interestingly enough, I would say that comparison is actually less valuable considering I think there's a larger canyon between those who have virtually nothing and those that have a little bit of something compared to those who have something and just want to get a little bit more. I'm not so stupid as to compare myself to literal Hollywood grade movie stars, I'm comparing myself to some Joe on the street who looks way better than I do and dresses a little bit better and actually has a woman on his hip. That isn't some monumental chasm, that's just some normal guy who is doing the things that I want to do. And therefore quite manageable as an expectation",

I dont care how strong an elephant is because i'm not competing with an elephant. \nBut i do have to compete with other men for dates and romantic access. Fairness is not a factor. The only factor is whether or not they are a valid competitor. Thats why i dont compare myself to women. It has nothing to do with fairness as much as its simply a fact that they are not my competition, they are irrelevant to the equation. I do not need to compare myself to them because i am not being compared to them. I am being compared to other men BY potential partners. \n\nSo \"figuring out that its an unfair comparison\" is not helpful, because it was never a factor to begin with.",

However, when it comes to other responsibilities, I struggle to take action and often find myself lying in bed scrolling through social media. Reflecting on this, I see some key differences between how I approach the gym and my other responsibilities:\n\n1. No Comparison: At the gym, I don‚Äôt compare myself to others. But when it comes to my career, I constantly think about successful people and feel pressure.\n\n\n2. Focus on Starting, Not Perfection: When I began going to the gym, my mindset was simple: Just start and aim for small improvements. I wasn‚Äôt chasing perfection.\n\n\n3. Consistency Over Quantity: I committed to doing less but being consistent. Even small efforts added up over time.\n\n\n4. Mood Doesn't Dictate Action: On days when I had no motivation or felt low, I still went to the gym, even if it meant doing very little. Surprisingly, those days often turned out to be great workout days.\n\n\n5. A Sense of Responsibility: I feel accountable to myself. An inner voice reminds me of the progress I‚Äôve made and warns that breaking the streak might undo all the effort I‚Äôve put in.",

Those are unfair because you're comparing a crafted version of someone else with your real version.

But then you'd realize how useless this type of comparison is because you could make up anything about yourselves and thus win any contest with almost zero effort - only problem is that it's not real. \nInstead a more healthy way would be to compare yourselves with people who you are in direct contact with and whose lives you can perceive more directly, like the ones belonging to your inner social circle that's not just digital.",

It doesn't matter if they got it through similar, quicker, or less lucky means that you did, but that they managed to get to a point in which you're envious of. They get more recognition, skills, and possibly a better living situation because of those skills, and you are left with your situation. To put salt in the wound, you can't just accept that you simply won't be at their level, and that even if you did, they would already be at a bigger, better point. It's like accepting your mediocrity!You want to be at their level, and you want to improve alongside them. You don't want to be as good as famous person (a) or successful person (b), you want to be able to feel like I can carry my own weight in an interpersonal relationship, whether it'd be with my friends or my family.¬†The fact of the matter is that there's a possibility of losing those relationships naturally because of a failure to improve and adapt to that is scary! Even the nicest people can't stand to wait for their peers because everyone is on their own journey in life; they need to move on and improve themselves. If you can't reach that point, especially by your 20s/30s, then as you stagnate people will rather seek out interpersonal relationships that are substantial for their social/financial/ideological needs in that current moment. As a result, what you're left with is an underdeveloped, mediocre, and shallow skill set, and an undeniable sense of loneliness from lack of people who are interested.",

Since birth, I've had mild CP which effects my left arm and leg. Growing up, particularly around 16 and onward, it was extremely easy for me to notice how other girls were gaining their independence whereas my journey was slower. Until recently, I finally had an epiphany: Why am I comparing myself to able-bodied young women? Which has since morphed into, why should I compare myself at all? I've realized that (however cliche it might sound) that everyone is truly on their own path. It has been comforting to me to remember that the \"right\" and \"wrong\" timing doesn't really exist. Accepting that this is the way my life looks, getting rid of bitterness and comparison, resting and not striving... Have really helped me look at comparison in a completely different way. Especially towards independence. I have caught myself comparing either up or down, and it's wild the effect that both have. I'm not usually one who posts comments often, but I hoped that my experience with comparison given my life situation might encourage others. <3 so glad I found this video.",

It is forced into each mindset, at childhood by irresponsible elders to make their responsibility easier; in adolescence by peer groups also; until it pursues like a shadow, till it becomes an obsession in many people. Those who don't compare themselves with some standardised people, are treated as those without social ambitions. This can destroy anyone, until you reject that very program, by understanding that it is just a ruse, an unnecessary part of your thinking baggage. And it has detrimental consequences. This makes one a stranger to oneself. The day you junk it, wholly, you can say hello to yourself-the truly amazing person and the best person you may have ever met.üéâüéâ",

When we‚Äôre not sure of the outcome of something\nWhen you know the outcome, fear and anxiety goes. Now our outcome as Christians is ‚ÄúMy God provideth ‚Äú\n\nThe pathway out of the valley of fret is in Philippians 4\n‚ÄúRejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your graciousness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Don‚Äôt worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.‚Äù\n‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Philippians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠4‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠4‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠7‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠CSB‚Ä¨‚Ä¨\n1. Celebrate the Lords goodness, rejoice in the Lord always. Don‚Äôt meditate on the mess, the more you stare at the problem, the bigger it gets. Lift up your eyes\nI WILL lift up my eyes to the hills, where does my help come from, it‚Äôs a decision, to focus on Christ\nFocus on God\nIs God bigger than this problem\nDoes God have solutions\nHas He gotten me out of this type of thing before\nIs He still on the throne\nDoes He have a track record\n\n2. Ask God for help: Make your requests known, ask and you will receive \nThe path to peace is always paved with prayer, that‚Äôs why the devil doesn‚Äôt want us to pray\n\n3. Now after praying replace your anxiety with gratitude: they cannot coexist\nNext time you‚Äôre anxious, begin to make a list of things to which you‚Äôre grateful \n\n4. Meditate on good things\nYou can‚Äôt control the circumstances but you can control how you think about them. \nPeace comes from a stream of thinking.\nWhen you remember what God says: He will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory.\n\nToday I will live today‚ù§\n\nRemember that It is not God‚Äôs will for you to be anxious",

Instead, try to focus on the present moment and take things one step at a time. Cultivate a positive mindset and surround yourself with uplifting people and activities. Take care of your physical and mental health through self-care practices like exercise, mindfulness, and healthy habits. With a calm and centered approach to life, you can be anxious for nothing and live a fulfilling and joyful life.",

Tbh its hard when you are taking si much inside you, smile in front of others like everything's ok. But when you can't and reach for help. They can't get it why you need one. They can't understand you coz they've never been to it. And if they had they still neglect it coz they don't want to ever admit it. When you not even have a single person to share. It feel like you're being engulfed by your negative thoughts. It aches so bad... I think after watching this. I'm feeling a bit motivatedm i'll try to happy. I'll try to love for myself. It will be hard coz i always try to accomplish expectations of others on me. But i won't exert myself now.",

She talks about the challenges of meeting expectations, handling pressure, and dealing with moments of self-doubt. Through it all, she discovered the importance of being kind to herself and treating herself like a friend.\n\nRather than seeking constant validation from others, she encourages us to look inward and support ourselves through both success and failure. Nivetha also emphasizes the strength in vulnerability, sharing how embracing her imperfections helped her grow and connect with people on a deeper level.\n\nHer message is simple but powerful: you‚Äôre with yourself 24/7, so be someone you can rely on. Celebrate who you are, flaws and all. Because when you truly befriend yourself, everything else begins to fall into place with a little more clarity and compassion.",

I do believe our social interactions & relationships, if positive definitely help us manage life's toughest seasons. Serving others, caring, giving, etc also has the same effects. Perspective definitely is key as well but it depends on the situation. We can tell ourselves we aren't really stressed, be optimistic, positive, etc but in many circumstances that will not change reality. The effects of stress are very real on the physical & mental health as well as how it impacts our relationships & job performance. Sometimes you just have to face reality & change things in your life. Wether that be associations, your employer, saying no & not over extending yourself, going to bed early, staying off social media, eating healthier, etc. Doing daily practical things to live a healthy well balanced life. We can't be or do it all. Keep trying & see how fast your life falls apart from the stress of it all. If it's in our control to change things for the better in our life then do it. You can change your perception but it doesn't mean it'll change reality. You still have circumstances that need to be addressed no matter how you view them. Sometimes we have stressors that do challenge us & help us grow. In these circumstances, yes, perception is key. But her methodology will not work in other scenarios. In America....people are stressed because they take on to much.",

    "text": "LOL  her exercise with the audience reminded me of Boot Camp. LOL  The increase of stress, has helped me and other service members to be resilient. On the other hand, we become so resilient that we become blind to internal factors we should pay attention to.   Example, continuing to work with a headache, push through, often without meds, this won't kill us, it will make us stronger.  Regarding the oxytocin, yes, it does work on relationship building, but only with those going through it with you, thus, troops one minded team building approach.  \n \nFor those who care about you, would be the other service members who become your family members.   It certainly gets complicated and literally heart breaking when you are assalted by another service member. That whole platform becomes dysfuntional, confusing and ultimatly isolating - NOW that is STRESS of Negative proportions.",

I do notice that I tend to get sick when I am stressed out, so when the video confirmed that the immune system struggles when it is out under drastic stress. It also scares me that it had also been linked to cancer, and other health risks like that. I also realized that making lists and having them never end can also be a stress causer rather than a stress reliever. It also helps to know that it isn‚Äôt just me feeling all the symptoms. Knowing that this is common with everyone makes it easier to deal with. \nSome of the things that stress me out most in life are my future and school. I get really worried about how my future will play out, and I am concerned that I will end up being unhappy in my future life. It effects me a lot because it makes me stay up at night, and it prevents me from having fun now because I am worried about where I will end up. I also stress a lot about school, because it has been drilled into my brain from a young age that I need to be my absolute best all the time. It really affects me because I feel like I have a never ending pressure on me to do well. Normally I cope by doing all my work at once then I can feel a little better when my checklist is empty.",

Plus I'm in my 3rd year of band class and playing my instrument just got boring. And it's hard. I don't like it. But there is no way I can turn back now, my parents paid so much money for it and if I tell them I don't like it, they will be furious. I'm so tired and I don't know if I should sleep, or play my loud instrument to turn in the band assignments I have due before my grade drops to an F. I feel like crying but I can't. Like I physically cannot, nothing is happening. I don't know what to do üò¨",
