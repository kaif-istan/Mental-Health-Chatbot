But there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day, occasionally clean up after yourself, pay your bills, generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being... but that\u2019s it. Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time.",

I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.\n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape.",

Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.\n\nI went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.\n\nIf people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.\n\nIt's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.\n\nMore than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the comments. I didn\u2019t expect to get any response. It\u2019s hard to describe, but I feel very moved that there are people out there that I reached in a small way for a short moment of time.",

I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.\n\nI spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. \n\nBut I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.\n\nEdit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester. \n\nAlso to all the people who said this post gave them a little kick in the ass to go back, were all going to do amazing :)",

What's more annoying is that while I can get help to make the night out more manageable, I'm not allowed to just leave. I'm stuck here.

But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.\n\nIt's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.\n\n When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. \n\nSorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.\n\nedit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles.

    "text": "I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I\u2019m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn\u2019t show up. This was my attempt to \u201creach out\u201d. Update:\n\nSorry in advance, I\u2019m on mobile and this is long. \nI really wasn\u2019t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! \n\nI\u2019d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.\n\nNext I\u2019d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn\u2019t know I had. \n\nI also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn\u2019t angry at her because I understand that she\u2019s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I\u2019ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! \n\nI\u2019m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn\u2019t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven\u2019t dwelled on it too much. She\u2019ll reach out when she\u2019s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. \n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven\u2019t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what\u2019s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I\u2019m better off being out of that toxic environment but it\u2019s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. \n\nI\u2019m also struggling with my marriage. I\u2019m a military spouse and it\u2019s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won\u2019t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it\u2019s been traumatic and hard. I haven\u2019t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I\u2019m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. \n\nI also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn\u2019t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn\u2019t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. \n\nIt just would\u2019ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would\u2019ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. \n\nIt\u2019s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. \nI also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!\n\nTL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I\u2019m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn\u2019t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",

I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.\n\nAnd with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.\n\nI wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.\n\nEdit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.\n\nEdit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",

It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.\n\nHe arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: \"Sorry I have to pull over.\" I reply: \"Ok is everything alright?.\" He says \"Sorry having a panic attack.\"\n\nI remained calm and told him, \"Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.\"\n\nLuckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.\n\nHe wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: \"I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",

We all deserve contentment, thank you so much \ud83d\udc95\n\nSo after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.\n\nAt the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said \u2018is it a big deal for you?\u2019 I said, \u2018yes, massively\u2019 and she just simply replied \u2018well then it\u2019s a big deal...\u2019, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.\n\nHonestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it\u2019s me that matters and someone else not thinking it\u2019s serious does NOT invalidate that. I\u2019m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won\u2019t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it\u2019s a serious problem to you.

    "text": "Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind. Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. \n\nMaking it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from \"beating\" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!\n\nAll credit for this tip goes to u/TomClinPsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason. Luckily I had screenshot it because it felt so profound to me.",

I constantly feel like I\u2019ve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don\u2019t have a bad relationship with any of them. I don\u2019t consider myself anti social.

My husband will reassure me that I\u2019ve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they\u2019ll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn\u2019t worry about it, but for some reason I can\u2019t shake the guilty feeling.

You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. \n\nWith anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.\n\nIt can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. \n\nConstant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction",

It was my time to go, I had cars behind me, I paid and I just couldn't do it. So I got out of my car and asked the car behind me if I they could back up and let me leave as I was having a panic attack and that they could have my paid car wash is they wanted. Turns out it was a mother and her teenage son and immediately this mom is like \"would you like me to go in the car wash with you if that would make you feel better?\" and as I was holding up the line I said sure and so she had her son drive her car and she hopped in my tiny two seater miata, and just sat and talked to me while I drove through the car wash. We just talked about Christmas and she was telling me how she had to sell her house and how her son liked my car and I'm just sitting there shaking like a leaf. And soon enough the car wash was over, we survived, my car didn't break down, and I dropped her back off with her son.\n\nOne of the most wholesome experiences of my life. \n\nIm going to try to find her on my towns Facebook page, try and give her some grocery and car wash money for the trouble.

He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.\n\nIm back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.\n\nI feel I'm making a big deal out of literally just being a decent human, but it was a big deal for me and my anxiety so I wanted to share the success.",

I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don\u2019t have plans, I\u2019m still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it\u2019s beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I\u2019m off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it\u2019s too hot, I don\u2019t want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I\u2019m relaxing and playing video games.

I\u2019ve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.\n\n*Edit to add, I\u2019m also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn\u2019t feel like this but apparently it doesn\u2019t work that way!",

    "text": "A Letter to those who don't have FOMO Dear Friend Who Doesn\u2019t Suffer from FOMO,\n\nYour mental attitude surprises me. You are unaffected when you go on Snapchat and see the stories that your friends post when they are at a party without you. The same is true when you go on Find My Friends and you see two of your best friends together while you are at home, alone. You don\u2019t feel like you are missing out on anything special and instead just passively watch, not letting anything get to your head. Maybe you are an introvert and being at large gatherings makes you uncomfortable. I understand how you can find happiness being alone, binging your favorite show.\n\nFOMO, also known as fear of missing out, is a word that eats at my mental health, but not yours. FOMO is defined as the anxiety brought about when you feel like you are missing out on experiences or knowledge. I am someone who always wants to be in the know and wants to be included. Even if I am unable to go somewhere because I have a conflict, I still want the invite. It\u2019s important to me to feel like I am wanted somewhere, while you can simply appreciate the fact that your friends are having fun.\n\nGiven today\u2019s culture, I am genuinely surprised that you don\u2019t suffer from crippling FOMO. Social media has perpetuated FOMO. When people go out, they attempt to produce FOMO in others by posting on social media. Maybe you understand better than I do that social media can be deceiving. When I am out and someone I am with posts a video, it can seem like the most fun thing ever, when it often really isn\u2019t. Plenty of research has shown the negative effects of social media on mental health. You see other people looking like they are having the time of their lives, and you aren\u2019t.\n\nI really wish that I could just look at something I am left out of and not care. I wish that not being included in something didn\u2019t leave me with terrible anxiety and feeling somewhat depressed. This feeling is consistent with my tendency to overthink things. Something small often becomes an ordeal in my mind as I construct reasons as to why I am alone or not invited, such as no one wants to hang out with me. This mindset becomes frustrating when someone I always hang out with, or used to, has moved to only hanging out with one of my other best friends.\n\nI recognize that we all struggle with problems and hardships in our lives. I\u2019m not saying that just because you don\u2019t have severe FOMO your life is perfect. Instead, it\u2019s just easy for me to imagine that your life is a little better than mine. I am sure that overcoming an obstacle or struggling with being an introvert is difficult to go through as well. With everything going on in our lives, I admire your ability to be independent. I wish I could happily spend my Friday nights alone without the feeling of FOMO.\n\nOne suggestion you might give me to overcome my FOMO is to look at technology and social media less. I know that I need to take a step back from technology, but that is easier said than done. I am simply too obsessed and addicted to technology. To cut technology and social media out of my life is nearly impossible. Another suggestion that I think is more feasible for me is to change my focus. Rather than focusing on not being there, should I be happy for my friends and look forward to being at the next event with them?  Is that your attitude? I understand I need to see things in an optimistic way as opposed to being jealous.\n\nI know you don\u2019t have similar feelings to me. But, my hope is that you can help change my mindset so that I don\u2019t constantly experience FOMO. I hope this letter finds you well, and please help me beat FOMO.\n\nBest,\n\nAbby",

I'm also scared I'm gonna drift from everyone cus I reallyyy don't want to. \nI wanted to go to this place so badly, but my parents wouldn't let me and this sounds selfish but it sucks knowing that my friends are gonna be living life and making new friends and making new memories and I'll never be in them. \nI just found this random community to send to and hopefully I'll make new friends in it ahahah",

Like there are so many opportunities out there and youre not going to see them anymore. Here's a good example, imagine you really wanted to meet Stan Lee (creator of Marvel), but now that he's dead that opportunity is gone. Or even Larry King, he's gone too. I have some goals in mind myself, I'd love to visit the UK, there are other famous people id like to meet too. I would especially love to meet Alison Brie (Mad Men, Community). She seems so nice and friendly. Or even Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones. I also like Betty White, now imagine meeting her before she passes.THESE opportunities im talking about. There are once in a lifetime opportunities that youre never going to get, and yet I hear \"youre young, you have your whole life ahead of you\". I could have met Stan Lee, that would've been a great experience. Whoever said \"good things come to those who wait\" should end up like something from a Tarantino film.",

I worked as an essential worker and was fortunate to save quite a bit of money during quarantine. In addition to work, I received scholarships from my university and have been saving a decent amount within a year (\\~$40,000). While everyone has been partying, eating out and living their life since safety measures have eased out, I'm still resistant towards spending too much. I want to save for a car and have a safety net when I graduate. I want to hopefully save enough money to start investing and possibly put a down payment on a house. \n\n My friends say I'm too young (24) to worry so much about money, but I don't like spending my money on nails, makeup, concerts, raves, expensive restaurants etc. like other people my age do. My mind is very future oriented, and I feel like my sacrifices of saving money now will pay off later on. I'm also pretty introverted and enjoy reading, watching TV/youtube, making bracelets and working with other hobbies that allow me to stay home and not spend so much. But, there's this constant FOMO that's always playing in the back of my head because I see others my age doing so much outside (and spending so lavishly). \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? For those older and have more wisdom, am I too frugal for my own good? I would also love to hear how others have amazing experiences while keeping their wallets in tact.",

You\u2019d think getting out would bring relief, a sense of safety\u2014but all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped, I\u2019d be able to feel again, to grieve for the lives lost, for the people I knew. But I feel nothing.\n\nI\u2019m in a place far from the violence now, surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day, complaining about trivial things\u2014traffic, their jobs, relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell, saw children torn apart in the streets, watched families disappear overnight, and now I\u2019m expected to care about small talk? I don\u2019t.\n\nEven after I got out, people wanted me to share my story, to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do, I feel detached, like I\u2019m telling someone else\u2019s story. I describe the destruction, the bodies, the screams, but it feels like I\u2019m reading from a script. I can\u2019tonnect to it anymore. It\u2019s like I left my emotions back there, buried under the rubble.\n\nI\u2019ve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying, even someone close, it doesn\u2019t register. I didn\u2019t cry when I found out a friend of mine didn\u2019t make it out. I didn\u2019t care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions, pretending to sympathize, but inside, it\u2019s just blank.\n\nPeople think escaping the genocide means survival, but it\u2019s not true. Part of me died there, and the part that made me human never made it out. Now, when I see images of what\u2019s still happening, or hear about others\u2019 struggles, I can\u2019t bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help, and I feel no urge to stop.\n\nI\u2019m broken in ways no one can see. On the outside, I\u2019m functioning. I smile, I work, I talk to people.

After they were arguing, my dad walked in to the house, shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head. I was right outside the door when it happened and I can\u2019t get the sound out of my head. Luckily, my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while I called 911. My eyes hurt but I can\u2019t sleep or close them with out everything replaying through my head. I feel like my life is in pieces and I don\u2019t know what to do. That\u2019s all I can really say...\n\nIf you need help, please get it. Because of a horrible combination of alcohol, guns and depression, my son no longer has the grandpa that he so much adored and I am now with out a dad.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for all the sentiments. I know it\u2019s strange to post something so personal to random people but hearing from all of you makes me feel less alone, I guess. I 100% agree about therapy and I am definitely no stranger to it and the help it gives. Sadly, money is tight and my insurance is shit so if anyone has any resources to help me find a cheaper solution when it comes to therapy, I would be very grateful.",

    "text": "I was inches from committing suicide 6 months ago, today I signed a lease for the nicest apartments in my city. Hang in there. Long story short, over the summer I was planning on driving my car over the edge of a cliff after I dropped some people off on vacation. I was overwhelmed in life and saw no way out aside from ending it all. Felt like a disappointment because I dropped out of college, worked as a personal trainer at a gym where I was taken advantage of and forced to work 16-17 hour days for pennies. Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn\u2019t picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I\u2019d get something, sometimes I\u2019d get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights. Mental health was at an all time low.\n\nI made some changes that started with therapy. After that, I got a lucrative new sales job, love the people I work with, practice Muay Thai weekly, work out every day, and am in a much better place mentally. \n\nIf you think this post is about me rooting my own horn... You\u2019re right. I\u2019m damn proud of the progress I\u2019ve made. Whatever it is you\u2019re going through, keep fighting. Keep waking up every day. Keep on keeping on.",

It portrays suicide as something \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cmeaningful\u201d and not what it really is. And the whole \u201cblame it on other people even though they tried to help me\u201d thing? Nope nope nope, that\u2019s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn\u2019t \u201chelp him enough\u201d even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it\u2019s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she\u2019s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful \u201csuicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people\u201d agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. \nIdk, personally I really don\u2019t like that show, and i think it\u2019s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like \u201cwho made you feel that way?\u201d like it was other people\u2019s fault. Like sure, trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but I just don\u2019t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way.",

I am usually the most positive, motivated, & outgoing person ever, but with COVID-19 affecting every aspect of my life, it wasn\u2019t a surprise I became deeply depressed. I had been trapped in my apartment for months with no job, money, or motivation. My mentality started shifting to something more cynical as well. One night in particular though, my boyfriend helped catalyze me getting better. It was insanely difficult to get out of bed. Sure I\u2019d get up maybe for an occasional snack or a quick bathroom break but I was just stuck mentally and physically, and in this case I hadn\u2019t left my mattress for days. I wasn\u2019t okay at all. Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn\u2019t even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life. I can\u2019t wait to marry him some day. Our relationship is him doing the most selfless acts of love for me, and even though he might not think much of his actions, they mean the world to me.

Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. \n\nI'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she \"succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19\" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to \"heaven\" and not \"hell\" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed \"sin\". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.\n\nI posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying \"Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not.\" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. \n\nThey fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. \n\nI'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the \"eyes of God\". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.\n\nI feel so bad for her. If her parents made \\*me\\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.\n\nJust needed to vent, thanks for reading.",

I guess I have mental health issues but im not in therapy at the moment, the current situation put that a bit on the back burner. But in the past I hated myself and attempted to end my life on a handfull of occasions, getting always closer to breaking and doing it.\n\nMaybe three month ago I was approched by a social worker and he helped me find my way to a home for young men in rough situations in just a couple of weeks. It is still hard to belive how easy that was. For about a month and a half I just kinda houng out and got acclimated but kept some of my old habbits up (not drugs, just kinda being aimless). With Corona crashing the party, I spend all of my time at home and lazed around.\n\nBut this week I started to work in the extensive garden. Planting crops, installing watering systems and stuff. Today I planted 100+ onions, waterd some salat and cleaned up a volleyball field. I felt good doing that. Then I had myself a nice cold shower and sat down to write this. Im happy right now. Im happy that I enjoyed work. I put the fear that all this shit in my life was because Im just lazy behind me. I enjoy working. Im crying.",

My bills are paid and I have no worries about keeping them paid. I never thought I would be stable enough to live on my own. For the past 10 years it's just been hospitalization after hospitalization. 13 hospital visits and 7 attempts later I thought there was no hope for me. But I did it. I love my job. I love my friends. I love my son. I love my life. And I'm going to keep fighting as hard as I can to maintain this. Not just for my son but for me, because I deserve to be happy. I deserve to feel safe.

You may think i\u2019m making this up but i\u2019m not i swear.\nTonight I held a knife to myself, and my cat ran to my side. At first I thought he was just trying to cuddle or get me to pet him, but I then noticed instead of rubbing into my hand, he was pushing the knife away. I broke down into tears and he immediately climbed into my lap. I moved and he laid beside me, and now refuses to let me out of his sight. His little paw is sitting on my arm, and when i move he moves. This is insane, but he stopped it, if it wasn\u2019t for my cat i\u2019d be dead. I can\u2019t thank him enough, he\u2019s my angel baby. I love him so much.\n\nUpdate: I\u2019m better, I decided to stay for him. Mentally I\u2019m not okay, but I\u2019m working on myself and I will get better soon. Thank you all for the love and support! Ive been getting more love from strangers than I get from friends and family. It means the world to me.\u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: I will not be showing pictures of my cat. Not in a mean way, but in a way for my privacy. I came on here to be \u201canonymous\u201d in ways, just so if someone i personally know comes across this they can\u2019t tell it\u2019s me. Thank you for all the support, it means a lot. I just wanted to share what saved my life last night.\n\nAnother Update: Hi! so I wanted to come back on here and give y\u2019all a new update. First off, thank you ALL for so much support and love! It means the world to me, for a few weeks I kept coming back to this post. Basically, I\u2019m doing amazing. I have new school opportunities, a new relationship, new friends. My life has truly turned around. I got out of my toxic relationship, healed, found to love myself again, and now I\u2019m loved by the most amazing guy. Thank you all, you helped me all through a very hard time! If anyone feels the way I felt in this post, please, feel free to reach out to me, call help, trust me on this. I\u2019ve had to do it, it\u2019s not scary trust me. But my messages are totally free for anyone who needs anything! Much love!",

I\u2019ve been sober since 2018, married with a child, and on paper I\u2019m doing well\u2014career, family, stability. But inside, I\u2019ve spent years quietly falling apart.\n\nMy first serious crash was at 22. I had gotten a girl pregnant, and before we could talk about it, she had an abortion without telling me. That destroyed me. I fell into a depression I couldn\u2019t explain to anyone. I stopped going to class. I isolated. I drank. A lot.\n\nOne night, drunk and desperate, I emptied my bank account ($3,000) and bought a one-way Greyhound ticket to L.A. I never made it\u2014I got robbed at the terminal, then arrested. The cops took me to a psych ward instead of jail. That might have saved my life.\n\nEventually I finished college. In 2011 I worked in Afghanistan with the military. We got hit with rocket attacks regularly, but I barely reacted. I wasn\u2019t brave\u2014I was numb. Nothing outside felt as intense as what was happening inside me.\n\nAt 27, I lost my job and ended up hospitalized again after another depressive spiral. The suicidal ideation had become familiar by that point. It would creep in and take over until I couldn\u2019t tell if I was in danger or just tired of existing.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop drinking until I was 33. One morning, I left for the hospital with loaded weapons sitting on my coffee table. I made a choice not to die that day\u2014and I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\n\nA doctor told me I had cirrhosis. That scared me sober. A year later, a liver specialist told me it was alcoholic hepatitis and that I\u2019d recovered. Somehow, my body gave me a second chance.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve stayed sober. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and I\u2019ve tried different meds. Some helped. Some triggered what I can only describe as months of euphoria. I spent thousands of dollars on Pok\u00e9mon cards. I told myself it was \u201cinvesting,\u201d but really, I was spinning out.\n\nWhen I crashed again, I ended up in the hospital for a week. The idea of bipolar has been brought up, but nothing formal. I don\u2019t know what I am\u2014other than confused.\n\nNow, even with meds and sobriety, I\u2019ve started raging at the smallest criticisms. It\u2019s like this explosive anger just erupts from nowhere. I hate how it makes me feel. I hate the way it affects my wife and kid. I want to stop, but I don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s happening inside me.\n\nI\u2019m doing everything I can. Therapy. Psychiatry. Meds. Honest reflection. And still\u2014some days I feel like I\u2019m right back on the edge I was at 10 years ago.\n\nI guess I\u2019m writing this because I needed to say it out loud. I don\u2019t have a clean ending or an insight to offer. Just this:\n\nI\u2019m still here. Still trying.",

And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn\u2019t so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn\u2019t have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.\n\nMissing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day. Having an unhealthy meal makes me sluggish, that in turn makes me feel that tiny bit worse which is enough to make me not do chores. I hate being in such a fragile state where i\u2019m not quite mega-depressed, just always on the verge of not leaving my bed for 48 hours. \n\n\nTL:DR Life is hard, I like easy things. Nothing worthwhile comes easily.",

I feel like in general I have become more forgetful, spacey, and just stupid. \n\nI have depression that, I think, has gotten worse over the years. I also have GAD, and every day after dealing with both I just feel so exhausted and braindead.\n\nI can't remember things anymore, I feel like I don't think properly, and I'm worried that people are starting to think less of me because of it.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? How did you overcome it?\n\n\nUpdate: WOW. I did not expect for this to blow up. Thank you all so much for sharing your experiences and kind words. I made this post after my mom got mad at me for forgetting to get gas in my car. Essentially she made me feel useless, and called me horribly irresponsible. On top of that I forgot to shut the door of the garage (luckily my sibling was able to help me before my mom noticed)\n\nAlso to answer some questions that gave come up:\n\nI am not on any medications\n\nI exercise daily (those stationary bikes are awesome!)\n\nI live in a very stressful home environment.\n\n\nI've seen a lot of helpful solutions, especially the one about getting a planner! Thank you all again. I have read all of your comments and appreciate you all so much <3",

I want to be invisible as I feel so uncomfortable i can\u2019t go out without feeling horrible. And of course you try and be brave and go out but instead you end up feeling terrible or have a panic attack in public instead? Or... \nIf anyone has any way to overcome this... it would be appreciated. I know the only way to over come it, is to keep going out. But it mostly ends up with me feeling awful and low or I just panic and cry... i mean I\u2019ve been picked on most of my life by school kids and teens. And just people in general. Okay thanks.",

Not sure if it's even this subreddit but I'm trying my luck. \n\nI lost my old account and don't remember it at all, because I changed my phone alot within those times.\n\nI was a 16 years old male with Bulimia Nervosa, I opened up here about my issues and alot of you good folks helped me. \n\nA random user reached out to me and started helping out, by giving me advice and opened up to me about her own problems. She gave me a place to vent and someone to reach out to. \n\nNow I haven't been bulimic for the last 2 years (20 now), I did it solely from education and will which I'm proud of, because proper therapy is not accessible here. I started exercising, and educated myself alot about nutrition and physical health, I sometimes relapse, but very rarely (once a day every couple of months or so). And she definetly helped me alot. And I want to thank her, and talk to her. Oh Boi do I have alot of stories to tell her about (unfortunately not all are good). \n\nShe is a married middle aged woman with kids, she is Pyromaniac, would talk to me about it and  about her daily routine of how she handles it. \n\n\nIf it's you, i'd love for us to chat again.",

I saw and heard it all. I didn\u2019t realize what was happening until after he lit himself and it was too late. I didn\u2019t film, I stood there stunned and watched. I don\u2019t know why I watched and I wish I didn\u2019t because what I saw is going to haunt me forever. I don\u2019t want to go into details but I was throwing up for a few hours after and I haven\u2019t been able to sleep without the help of a lot of Valium and alcohol. I saw my therapist for an emergency appointment but I think it\u2019s too soon for anything to help. \n\nI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing this. I feel selfish for being so upset about something that didn\u2019t have anything to do with me. I feel so sorry for that man. I watched him experience one of the most painful ways to go. I also feel mad at him. People shouldn\u2019t have had to see that. I\u2019m young which means I\u2019m going to be stuck with the sight and sound and smell of him burning for the next 60 something years of my life. Fuck, man.",
